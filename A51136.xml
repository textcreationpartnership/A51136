            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE matters contended for in this Treatiſe, are on all hands confeſſed to be very weighty, and neceſſary to our Salvation, which in ſhort are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The true knowledge of God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, which to know is life Eternal. Now theſe new <hi>Eutychians,</hi> which here in this Treatiſe I oppoſe, ſay, That the Divine Nature of Chriſt which was in the beginning with God, and was God, <hi>Joh. 1.1, 2.</hi> compared with the <hi>14</hi> verſe, was made fleſh, <hi>viz.</hi> by turning his Divine Nature or Godhead into fleſh, even at the Water was turned into Wine at <hi>Cana,</hi> Joh. <hi>2.9.</hi> which ceaſed. to be Water and became Wine; ſo the Eternal Word, <hi>viz.</hi> God the Creator of Heaven and Earth, ceaſed from being a Creator, to become a Creature, <hi>viz.</hi> Man, and died for our ſins, as theſe men ſay, as you may ſee in this inſuing Diſcourſe. Nov this Opinion I call Erronious and Heretical, and indeavour to prove it ſo, as alſo impoſſible;
<pb facs="tcp:98571:3"/>ſith God is Immortal, and Immutable, yea, Perfection it ſelf, and therefore cannot die, nor yet be changed, as I have proved in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They ſay in plain words, That our bleſſed Mediator did not take his fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> nor of <hi>David;</hi> and ſo by Conſequence he was not the true Son of <hi>David:</hi> and if ſo, how can we be ſaved? ſith all the Promiſes are Yea and Amen, in him that was the true Son of <hi>David,</hi> as the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> may ſee in the inſuing Diſcourſe, which is a conſequence of the former Opinion. Now albeit ſome of them that be more ſubtile, begin to bogle and will not ſpeak plainly to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, What the Word was before it was fleſh? but ſay they cannot tell.</p>
            <p>We ſay, he was either a Creator, or a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſith we know no other thing that could die for us: and (as was ſaid before) God the Creator of all things could not die, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: Therefore if they deny him to be a Creator, then we think they muſt be <hi>Arrians</hi> or <hi>Socinians,</hi> which two Opinions, they ſay, they abhor as falſe and erroneous; but the other part of them ſay ſtill, as they all uſe to ſay heretofore, That he was of the uncreated ſubſtance of his Father, their Eſſence being one: but yet they all agree in this, That he
<pb facs="tcp:98571:3"/>that was the Eternal Word did, not take his Fleſh of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as we ſay he did.</p>
            <p>Now I can aſſure thee, <hi>Chriſtian Reader,</hi> I have had no mind to Diſpute, much leſs to Write about theſe great Myſteries; which I humbly believe and adore: but the Oppoſition that theſe men of late have made againſt the Truth, &amp; the great danger that I know ſome poor Souls have been &amp; yet are in concerning theſe things about God &amp; Chriſt; as alſo the exhortation of the Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> which bids us <hi>earneſtly contend for that Faith which was once delivered to the Saints,</hi> hath inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me in this great Work; which I confeſs I am not ſufficient for, but hope by this to open a door to ſome abler Pen to inlarge upon, and further explain theſe great Myſteries, that ſo the <hi>little children</hi> that <hi>John</hi> bids <hi>keep themſelves from Idols,</hi> may know them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than yet I doubt they do.</p>
            <p>Now the principal things I treat of in this Book, are theſe Four: Firſt, <hi>Of the Eſſence of God.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Of the Holy Trinity.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>About the Perſon of Chriſt.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Of the union of Natures in that one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon:</hi> As you may ſee, if the Lord open your eyes, as he did the two Diſciples that were a going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> and that he
<pb facs="tcp:98571:4"/>may ſo do, is and ſhall be the Prayer of the Author of this Book to God for thee.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I would be an inſtrument in the hand of God to keep thee from Hereſie, or pluck thee out if thou art in it, I have thought good to open to thee in ſome meaſure the nature of that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>nable ſin of Hereſie, from the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> which I will uſe as a <hi>Preface</hi> to this Book; to the which I refer thee, as alſo to the Book it ſelf, for thy ſatisfaction: and ſhall pray that God would be pleaſed to make it effectual for the end intended; which is Gods Glory, and the Salvation of poor Souls, and remain,</p>

            <p>I hope, through the good aſſiſtance of Jeſus Chriſt, to treat of theſe Eight Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars briefly, as an Introduction to this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It being the main deſign of Satan to ſubvert the Kingdom of God; he hath in all Ages uſed his utmoſt endeavour ſo to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98571:5"/>do. He aſſaulted our firſt Parents, even when they were in innocency; and having prevailed ſo far, that the firſt Covenant hath been broken, and thereby the Will of Man depraved; though God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the new Covenant of his Grace and Mercy to ſave through his Son Jeſus Chriſt all thoſe that do believe in him, yet Satan and his inſtruments, have not ceaſed in all Ages ſince the firſt diſcovery thereof, to make oppoſition againſt it. When God was pleaſed to take his People by the hand to bring them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by his Servant <hi>Moſes</hi> to direct them in the way of his Covenant; there wanted not a <hi>Balaam</hi> to caſt a ſtumbling-block before the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to eat things ſacrificed to Idols, and to commit fornication. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.1, 2. When <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> the Prophet of the Lord, taught <hi>Iſrael</hi> the knowledge of the true God, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of <hi>Baal</hi> ſought to teach them the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry of <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 King. 18. When <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> the Prophet of the Lord, taught the People obedience, according to the Word of the Lord, then <hi>Hananiah</hi> ſpake in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it, in the preſence of all the People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.11. It would be too long to recite every particular mentioned in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98571:6"/>holy Scriptures, wherein the oppoſition is recorded which falſe Prophets have made againſt the Truth of God, and againſt thoſe that God hath been pleaſed to ſend to declare it: If we conſider the work that falſe Prophets, and falſe Teachers do, and the way they take to effect it, we ſhall find it is a moſt deſperate deſign they are engaged in, it is no leſs than bringing in of damnable Hereſies; ſuch, as being retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do overthrow the Faith, and even make ſhipwrack of a good Conſcience; See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. What can be worſe than to ſet up for a God, that which is not God, and for Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that which the true God never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.9. And if alſo we take notice of the way that falſe Teachers take to effect their purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring in Hereſies into the Church, it will be found to be carried on with much ſubtilty, the Text tells us, they do it <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily.</hi> We muſt not think that falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers do teach no truth at all, but rather together with the Truth, which in part they deliver, they mix with it certain Errors, of ſo deſtructive a nature to it, that the Truth is overthrown by the Error. The falſe Teachers mentiomed, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1. would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98571:6"/>not ſay that the Diſciples ought not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt for Salvation, yet what they taught amounted to the ſame, which was, <hi>That except ye be circumciſed after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Moſes, ye cannot be ſaved:</hi> See <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4. All the falſe Teachers are not ſaid to deny the Reſurrection, but ſome denyed it, others ſaid it is paſt already; See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Secondly, When we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly to what danger Hereſie doth expoſe us, we had need to pray to God that he will keep us, that we be not led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the Error of the Wicked, and ſo fall from our ſteadfaſtneſs, but rather that we may grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18. For there be many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which are not ſo dangerous as Hereſie; there may be error in Knowledge and alſo in Practice, which yet are far ſhort of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie: Alas, we know but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. And for Practice, when we have done all, we are unprofitable Servants, we have done but what was our duty to do. But Hereſie is a work of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20. 'tis reckoned up with Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs; with Idolatry, Witchcraft,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98571:7"/>Hatred, Variance, Wrath, Strife, Sedition; with Envyings, Murders, Drunkenneſs, and ſuch-like. Can this be good that is martialled in the midſt of theſe? For, when the holy Spirit by the Word of God ſets forth the nature of Hereſie, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth it to Leaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.9. Becauſe Leaven is of ſuch a nature, that it makes all the lump to ſavour of it: So Hereſie, if it be not truly removed, it gives all that imbrace it participation of its ſowr reliſh. Likewiſe it is compared to a Gangreen, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17. which is a Venom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſuch an eating nature, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a member be cut off, the whole will be deſtroyed, unleſs it be ſpeedily ſtopped, before it hath taken too much root in the part infected with it. So it is with Hereſie, if it be not ſpeedily ſtopped, it will grow to ſuch a head, that the Heretick, though he be condemned of himſelf, yet he will not be turned, but muſt be cut off; ſee <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10, 11.</p>
            <p>For, Thirdly, The nature of Hereſie is ſuch, that it oppoſeth the Doctrine of God, and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. See that famous place in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>Beloved,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98571:7"/>common Salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that you ſhould earneſtly contend for the Faith which was once delivered unto the Saints,</hi> verſ. 4. For there are certain men crept in unawares, which were before of old ordained to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into laſciviouſneſs, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Here we ſee the damnable nature of Hereſie, it denyes God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo takes away the object of ſaving Faith: for ſaving Faith hath for its object God and Chriſt; yet ſo as we firſt believe in Jeſus Chriſt, God-Man, a Saviour unto all them that do believe in him, and by Chriſt we believe in God, ſee 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; a God and Father unto all them that believe.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe things are beſt ſeen by their contraries, I will lay down four Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which every true Chriſtian owns (or ought to own) and every Heretick denyes in part or in whole; whereby you may clearly diſcern the deſtructive nature of Hereſie to all true Religion and Piety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. God the Father, Son, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is the object of ſaving Faith. No
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98571:8"/>man was ever ſaved without this Faith: no man ever called upon God, but by the help of the holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. As no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Chriſt, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any man ſay that God is God, but by the holy Ghoſt: neither did God ever hear any man that called upon him for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but for his Sons ſake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Jeſus Chriſt God-Man is the object of Faith, and therefore he is to be believed in; <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me,</hi> Joh. 14.1. So likewiſe his Apoſtles taught, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thine houſe,</hi> Acts 16.31. teſtifying both to the <hi>Jews</hi> and alſo to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; yea, we are commanded of God to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>And this is his Commandment, That we ſhould believe on his Son Jeſus Chriſt; and love one another, as he gave us Commandment:</hi> and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive remiſſion of ſins by this Faith; See <hi>Acts</hi> 26.15, 16, 17, 18. where Chriſt ſaith to St. <hi>Paul, I ſend thee to the Gentiles to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan unto God; that they may receive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, and an inheritance among
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98571:8"/>them which are ſanctified by Faith that is in me.</hi> So that Jeſus Chriſt is God and Man in one Perſon: for none can forgive ſins but God, none can be the primary and proper object of Faith but God; Faith being a part of divine moral Worſhip: for we give honour to him in whom we believe. None can be a Mediator between God and Man, but he that is God and Man in one Perſon; none can offer a Sacrifice to God for the ſin of man, ſo as to procure peace and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Conſcience, but Jeſus Chriſt who is God and Man in one Perſon; God, of the ſubſtance of his Father, begotten before the World: and Man, of the ſubſtance of his Mother, born in the World; perfect God, and perfect Man, of a reaſonable Soul and humane Fleſh ſubſiſting, <note n="*" place="margin">See the Creed of <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Jeſus Chriſt, as God-Man, is our Saviour, he united our Nature to his Divine Nature; he was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> he kept the Law, and fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, and then ſuffered Death for us; as Man he died, and by the power of his Godhead he was raiſed again, <hi>that we might be juſtified by faith in him:</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24, 25. ſo that <hi>we have redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98571:9"/>according to the riches of his Grace,</hi> Eph. 1.7. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſireth to <hi>know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> among the <hi>Corinthians, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.1, 2. <hi>Our Communion with God is by faith in the Son of God,</hi> ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>The life which I now live in the Fleſh,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me, Gal.</hi> 2.20. So that Chriſt is the object of divine Worſhip, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12. Of <hi>that hope which is ſaving, and maketh not aſhamed,</hi> Col. 1.27. Rom. 5.5. of our <hi>ſincere and greateſt love,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.22. of <hi>our abſolute ſervice, and divine faith,</hi> Rom. 14.9, 18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. Oh the excellency of Jeſus Chriſt to a believing Soul! Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> reprehends thoſe as highly injurious to miſerable Souls, who by calling of God the object of Faith ſimply, in the mean while omit Chriſt, without whom there can be no Faith nor Acceſs to God, &amp;c. See <hi>Calv. Inſtitut. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. We, in order of nature, not of time, believe firſt in Chriſt; and by Chriſt in God. As the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>who verily,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was fore-ordained, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World;</hi> but <hi>was manifeſted in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98571:9"/>theſe laſt times for you,</hi> who <hi>by him</hi> do <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God, that raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory, that your Faith and hope might be in God,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.20, 21. So that Chriſt is the Way, the Truth, and the Life; <hi>No man cometh unto the Father, but by him,</hi> Joh. 14.6. <hi>He is the Mediator,</hi> as the Apoſtle teacheth his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Extreams come not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether but by their midſt, from the nature of a juſt God unto a Sinner. God in Chriſt is a tender Father, out of Chriſt a conſuming fire. Man's way to God is by the Man-God, for Chriſt as the Redeemer is the Mediator, not the ultimate object of Faith; for by Chriſt we believe in God.</p>
            <p>Beloved in our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, I beſeech you to conſider the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and damnable nature of Hereſie, which is contrary to theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> which I have laid down, and proved from the Holy Scriptures. Hereſie, it denyes God, it denyes his Eſſence, it denyes the Trinity of Perſons, it denyes the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; it denyes his two Natures; the Divine Nature, whereby he is God;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98571:10"/>the Humane Nature, whereby he is Man: it denyes his Perſonality, whereby the two Natures (ſubſiſt in one Perſon; it denyes the object of ſaving Faith, of Divine Worſhip; it denyes ſatisfaction made by Chriſt unto the Father; it denyes Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin, Juſtification, Adoption, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and the hope of Glorification; in a word, what truth doth it not deny? O the deſtructive and damnable nature of Hereſie! The Apoſtle charges the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> but with one Hereſie in the 15th <hi>Chapter. How ſay ſome among you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there is no reſurrection of the dead.</hi> But behold, what are the natural conſequences thereof! how many Hereſies doth that one Hereſie let in, or is the root of? Firſt, <hi>If there be no reſurrection of the dead, then is not Chriſt riſen.</hi> 2. <hi>If Chriſt is not riſen, then is your preaching vain;</hi> 3. <hi>and your faith is alſo vain:</hi> 4. <hi>yea, and we are found falſe witneſſes of God, becauſe we have teſtified of God that he raiſed up Chriſt, whom he raiſed not up if ſo be that the dead riſe not.</hi> 5. <hi>For if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt riſen.</hi> 6. <hi>And if Chriſt be not riſen, your faith is vain, and you are yet in your ſins.</hi> 7. <hi>Then they which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98571:10"/>are faln aſleep in Chriſt, are periſhed.</hi> 8. <hi>If in this life we have only hope, we are of all men moſt miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, 4thly, Miſerable will be the end of thoſe that bring into the Church of Chriſt <hi>damnable Hereſies,</hi> they will bring upon themſelves in ſo doing <hi>ſwift deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> pronounceth a Woe upon them, and tells us <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13. <hi>that they have gone in the way of</hi> Cain, <hi>and in the error of</hi> Balaam <hi>for reward, and periſhed in the gainſaying of</hi> Kore; that they are <hi>ſpots in their Feaſts of Charity, Clouds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Water, Trees whoſe fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; raging waves of the Sea, foaming out their own ſhame, wandring Stars, to whom is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever.</hi> So likewiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, 17. ſhows that the falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſhall be reſerved unto the day of Judgment to be puniſhed. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſets forth the puniſhment of Antichriſt and all his Adherents, <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they received not the love of the Truth that they might be ſaved; for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lye: that they all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98571:11"/>might be damned, that loved not the Truth, but had pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.9, 10, 11, 12. It will be good for us therefore to take heed : for it is a fearful thing to fall into the hand of the living God: <hi>for our God is a conſuming fire.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31. &amp; l2.29.</p>
            <p>Yet, Fiftly, it is lamentable to think that Hereſie ſhould have ſuch ſucceſs in the World: for is it not a wonder that many ſhould follow thoſe wayes that are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. But it is, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, when men receive not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved; then God in his juſt Judgment ſends them, or gives them over to ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Lye. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells <hi>Titus,</hi> that there were many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, and vain talke s, and deceivers; which it ſeems had ſuch ſucceſs, that they ſubverted whole houſes, (<hi>viz.,</hi> turned them from the Faith) teaching things, which they ought not, for filthy lucre ſake, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9, 10. inſomuch that all they that were in <hi>Aſia</hi> were turned away from him. See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14 15. <hi>Yea, the Spirit ſpeaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that in the latter dayes ſome ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Faith, giving heed to ſeducing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98571:11"/>Spirits, and Doctrines of Devils,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.1. So, <hi>all the World wondered after the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.3. <hi>and worſhipped the Beaſt, and the image of the Beaſt;</hi> and was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured with their Idolaty, that they ſay, <hi>Who is like unto the Beaſt? Who is able to make War with him?</hi> verſ. 4.</p>
            <p>For, Sixthly, That which is the moving Cauſe which ſets falſe Teachers on work, is Covetouſneſs; that which made <hi>Balaam</hi> ſo deſire to curſe the People of God, was Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs: The Apoſtle tells us, he <hi>loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jude 16.</note> 2 Pet. 2.15. <hi>For the love of Money</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>is the root of all evil, which whilſt ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows,</hi> l Tim. 6.10.</p>
            <p>But, Seventhly, When the heart is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, 'tis no wonder if the tongue be falſe; therefore our Apoſtle tells us, That the Engine, or Inſtrument, which the falſe Teachers ſhall uſe to carry on their deſign of beguiling unſtable Souls, ſhall be <hi>feigned words,</hi> words of deceit, <hi>ſwelling words of vanity;</hi> ſee 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18, 19. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Titus, There are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>many unruly and vain talkers, and deceivers,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98571:12"/>whoſe mouths muſt be ſtopped, who ſubvert whole houſes,</hi> Tit. 1.10. they ſubvert or turn away the minds of their Hearers from the Truth, by falſe and deceitful words; <hi>For evil men, and ſeducers, ſhall wax worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.13.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Eightly, and laſtly, Let us behold with horror and compaſſion, the ſad condition of thoſe miſerable Souls that are carried away with the Error of the wicked; <hi>The falſe Teachers</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>ſhall make Merchandize of you.</hi> Is it not a cruel thing to ſell a man into ſlavery? How much more cruel is it to ſell the Souls of Men and Women into worſe ſlavery and bondage, than the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> bondage? Better that man had never been born, than to be an inſtrument to bring any Perſons into Hereſie; As <hi>thoſe that convert Sinners from the Error of their way, ſhall ſhine as the Stars for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 12.3. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. ult. So for thoſe that lead them in the way of Hereſie, is <hi>reſerved the miſt of darkneſs for ever,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.17. <hi>If the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch,</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.14. Falſe Teachers are unmerciful. For
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98571:12"/>as the true Servants of God labour to have the Church of Chriſt eſtabliſhed in the true Faith; ſo the Children of <hi>Belial</hi> do ſell them into Perdition, making them as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>twofold more the Child of Hell than themſelves,</hi> ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.15.</p>
            <p>Beloved, I will now conclude this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> by declaring unto you what Hereſies I principally oppoſe in this enſuing <hi>Treatiſe, viz.</hi> All that oppoſe the Eſſence of God, the Trinity of Perſons, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Union of Natures, &amp;c. <hi>For this is life eternal, that they may know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> Joh. 17.3.</p>

            <p>I <hi>AM</hi>] <hi>viz.</hi> I am the only true God, truly ſubſiſting, and not only through the opinion of men, as Idols are; I am he that have an everlaſting being, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, ſubſiſting of it ſelf, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending from others, infinite, moſt ſimple, the Author and Cauſe of the being of all things: not a borrowed, changeable, finite, dependent, and compound being, &amp;c. as all the Creatures have. Of this mine Eſſence will I give thee the higheſt, moſt expreſs, and general name of all; <hi>[He that is]</hi> Which hath remained in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98571:14"/>the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and was then firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God: <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. The <hi>French Annot. He that is;</hi> which is the Name that we tranſlate, (for want of another more proper) <hi>the Lord God;</hi> which Name God then newly revealed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 6.3. See <hi>Diodat</hi>'s Annotations upon the Text. The Eſſence of God abſolutely conſidered, is that one pure and meer act, by which God is God. Becauſe through the weakneſs of our underſtanding we cannot apprehend it in any meaſure by one act, it hath pleaſed God to give unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf many Names and Attributes, by the help of which we may the better conceive thereof. The Divine Attributes are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eſſential Properties, which God is pleaſed in Scripture to aſcribe or attribute unto himſelf; they are alſo called the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, or divine Predications, or Titles. They are not diſtinguiſhed from the Eſſence really, but notionally; that is, They are not diſtinguiſhed at all in God, but only to us-ward, according to our manner of conceiving. The Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Nature, is either ſimpleneſs, or the infiniteneſs thereof. The ſimpleneſs of his Nature, is that by which he is void of all Logical Relation. He hath not in him,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98571:14"/>ſubject or adjunct. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf:</hi> compared with <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>But if we walk in his light, as he is light;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs.</hi> Hence, it is manifeſted, that to have life, and to be life: to be in light, and to be light, in God are all one. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God ſubject to generality, or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality: whole, or parts: matter, or that which is made of matter: for ſo there ſhould be in God divers things, and one more perfect than another. Therefore, whatſoever is in God, is his Eſſence, and all that he is, he is by Eſſence. The ſaying of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 6th <hi>Book</hi> and 4th <hi>Chap.</hi> of the Trinity, is fit to prove this; <hi>In God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be, and to be juſt, or mighty, are all one: but in the mind of man, it is not all one to be, and to be mighty, or juſt: for the mind may be deſtitute of theſe vertues, and yet a mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is manifeſt, That the Nature of God is Immutable, and Spiritual. God's immutability of Nature, is that by which he is void of all compoſition, diviſion, and change. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>With God there is no
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98571:15"/>variableneſs, nor ſhadow of changing.</hi> Mal. 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord, and am not changed.</hi> Where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.6.</note> 
               <hi>That God repenteth,</hi> &amp;c. the meaning is, That God changeth the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as men do that repent: therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it ſignifieth not any mutation in God, but in his actions, and ſuch things as are made and changed by him. God's Nature is Spiritual, in that it is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and therefore inviſible. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a Spirit.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.17. <hi>To the King Eternal, Immortal, Inviſible, the only Wiſe God, be glory and honour for ever and ever.</hi> Col. 1.15. <hi>Who is the image of the inviſible God.</hi> The infiniteneſs of God, is twofold; his Eternity and exceeding Greatneſs. God's Eternity is that by which he is without beginning and ending. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.2. <hi>Before the Mountains were made, and before thou hadſt formed the Earth and the World, even from everlaſting to everlaſting, thou art our God.</hi> Rev. 1.8. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega,</hi> that is, <hi>The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending, ſaith thé Lord; which is, which was, and which is to come.</hi> God's exceeding Greatneſs, is that by which his incomprehenſible Nature is every where preſent, both within and without the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.3. <hi>Great is the Lord,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98571:15"/>and worthy to be praiſed, and his greatneſs is incomprehenſible.</hi> 1 King. 8.27. <hi>Is it true indeed that God will dwell on the Earth? Behold, the Heavens, and the Heaven of Heavens are not able to contain thee: how much leſs is this Houſe that I have built?</hi> Jer. 23.24. <hi>Do not I fill the Heaven and Earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Hence it is plain,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That He is only One, and that indiviſible, not many. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. <hi>One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all.</hi> Deut. 4.35. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee it was ſhewed, that thou mighteſt know that the Lord he is God, and that there is none but [He alone.]</hi> 1 Cor. 8.4. <hi>We know that an Idol is nothing in the World, and that there is none other God but [Oxe.]</hi> And there can be but one thing infinite in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That God is the knower of the Heart. For nothing is hidden from that Nature, which is within all things, and without all things, which is included in nothing, nor excluded from any thing. Becauſe, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.39.) the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very work of the mind. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.1, 2. <hi>Thou knoweſt my ſitting down, and my riſing up, thou underſtandeſt my cogitation afar off.</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98571:16"/>All the Attributes in God are one and the ſame perfection. It is better ſaid of God that he is his Attributes, than that he hath Attributes: the Attributes are not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in God, but in our manner of underſtanding, who being unable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that meer act at once, do conceive thereof after the manner of many acts. The Sun when he is perpendicular, had it an Eye, would behold all that at once, which we, by reaſon of the inadequateneſs and and unproportionableneſs of our ſight, are neceſſiated to view by parts. In God all things are one and the ſame, according to the nature of God; though out of God many and divers, according to their own proper and created nature. The ſame heat in the Sun produceth divers effects, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the various diſpoſition of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: hardneſs in Clay, ſoftneſs in Wax, &amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>Poſitive</hi> Attributes,<note place="margin">Poſitive.</note> are ſuch which ſo aſcribe ſome perfection to God, as not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring any reſpect unto the Creatures exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, or in preſent being; by theſe, our underſtanding is helped in our meditation of God, by way of eminency; the more principal of them, are in number ſix: 1. Holineſs, 2. Wiſdom, 3. Will, 4. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98571:17"/>5. Omnipotency. 6. Perfection. To which, or ſome of which, the reſt of like nature may conveniently be referred. But I ſhall ſpeak but to one of theſe in this place, <hi>viz.</hi> Perfection, which I think com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all the reſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perfection</hi> is God all-ſufficient, and all-excellent: not having need of any thing, giving ſufficient unto, and having in him the perfection of all things, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, 2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. This Attribute renders God as that infinite Sea of all Happineſs. Perfection is increated Glory: that is, all the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes in one word; as happineſs is the ſum of man's good, ſo glory is the ſum of all God's Attributes. The Perfection of God is eſſential, independent, unlimited, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out increaſe, or decreaſe: as the power of ſubordinate cauſes is contained in the firſt cauſe virtually; And as the Authority of under Officers is in the Prince after a more excellent manner; ſo the virtue of all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes is contained in the firſt cauſe eminently. The word eminently taken in its ſtrict and proper ſenſe, ſeemeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the effect to be in the cauſe, not only in a more excellent manner than in it ſelf, but alſo in a ſuper created manner. Things are in God agreeable to the nature of God:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98571:17"/>in themſelves according to their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Eminential continency, and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al continency, (that is; for one thing to be contained in another eminently, as the excellency of the Creature is in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: or virtually, as all things ſaleable are in money, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.9.) are not the ſame: the firſt is proper to the Creator, the ſecond is found in the Creature. The Eſſential perfection of God is increated Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Eternal, alwayes the ſame, from which nothing can be taken, to which nothing can be added. The acknowledgment of the manifeſted perfections of God, is Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: <hi>viz.</hi> The act of the Creature done in time, admitting more or leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God is known, or acknowledged.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If God in his Nature, or Eſſence, be ſimply, abſolutely, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely perfect, then muſt he needs be a moſt pure and ſimple act, without any Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality at all: <hi>i. e.</hi> he muſt needs be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſo have been from Eternity, whatſoever he is capable of being, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is poſſible for him ever to be. The reaſon of this, is, becauſe all Potentiality; of Poſſibility of being any thing more, or any thing beſides, what a perſon, or thing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98571:18"/>is, for the preſent, argueth imperfection; which is clearly proved thus: Whatſoever it is poſſible for a perſon (or thing) to be, which at preſent he is not, muſt needs be ſomething, which will either add unto his being, and make it better; or elſe take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his being, and ſo make it worſe: or elſe be a thing meerly indifferent, and ſo of no concernment unto him at all. So then, if a man be capable of being any thing, which yet he is not, for the better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his condition, it is a cleer caſe that his preſent condition, or being, is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: for he is as yet deſtitute of that, which ſhould add perfection unto him. If he be capable of any thing, or of being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, which yet he is not, to the making of his preſent condition worſe, here the caſe is yet more cleer, that ſuch a man's condition is not perfect. For to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the deprivation or loſing of any good, which a man enjoyeth for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, manifeſtly argueth weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, If a man be capable of being any thing which yet he is not, ſuppoſe it be without any relation at all to his condition either for the better or the worſe, yet this alſo plainly argueth imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98571:18"/>For it ſuppoſeth, that a man hath ſomething, hath a capacity, which is a meer ſuperfluity to him, and doth him no good, yea which he knoweth not how to improve for his good; and this, as apparently as either of the former, argueth imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. So that certain it is, that if the nature and being of God be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and infinitely perfect, he muſt needs be a pure and meer act, all in preſent and actual being, whatſoever it is poſſible for him ever to be. <hi>This moſt intire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat actuality of the Divine Nature and being is</hi> (I preſume, ſaith Mr. <hi>John Goodwyn</hi> in his Book entituled, <hi>Redemption Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> pag. 48.) <hi>generally ſubſcribed by all Reformed Divines. God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Zanchy</hi>) <hi>is a moſt pure, and moſt ſimple act, and no wayes capable, or in any poſſibility, of being any thing more or leſs than what he is.</hi> And from this actuality of God, he infers both his abſolute immutability, and infinity of his perfection. <hi>It is affirmed</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>) <hi>as with one mouth, of all that are godly, that God is not changed; in as much as this would be a certain ſign as well of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, as inconſtancy, in him. The reaſon why God is not changed, nor capable of any change whatſoever, is, becauſe he is a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98571:19"/>moſt pure, abſolute and compleat act,</hi> i. e. <hi>he is for the preſent whatſoever it is poſſible in any reſpect for him to be: So that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his ownipotency it ſelf, he hath no power to make the leaſt alteration or change in himſelf, either in nature, will, or action.</hi> Upon the account of this Authors credit, who intereſteth all the godly in the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and belief of God's unchangeableneſs, (and conſequently of that perfect actuality, which we aſſert) I judge it needleſs to make any further levy of teſtimonies in this behalf.</p>

            <p>Firſt, the proof of it from the Scriptures. Secondly, the uſe of it.</p>
            <p>AMongſt the multitude of Scriptures holding forth the Doctrine of the Trinity of Perſons in the Divine Eſſence, let it at preſent ſuffice to tranſcribe theſe Texts, becauſe I ſhall ſpeak more about the Trinity hereafter in the Queſtions and Anſwers. <hi>And God ſaid, Let us make man
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98571:19"/>in our own Image, after our likeneſs,</hi> Gen. 1.26. <hi>And the Lord God ſaid, Behold the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil,</hi> Gen. 3.22. <hi>Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not underſtand one anothers ſpeech,</hi> Gen. 11.7. <hi>But none ſaith, Where is God my Maker?</hi> (ſo they ſay it is in the Hebrew) <hi>who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſongs in the night?</hi> Job 35.10. <hi>And one cryed unto another, and ſaid, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hoſts, the whole Earth it full of his Glory,</hi> Iſa. 6.3. <hi>And the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a Dove, and lighting upon him; and lo a voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Mat. 3.16, 17. <hi>Go therefore, and teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Matth. 28.19. <hi>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me,</hi> Joh. 15.26. <hi>The Grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all Amen.</hi> 2 Cor. 13.13. <hi>For there are three that bear Record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Spirit; and theſe three are one,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.7.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:98571:20"/>
            <p>Hence appeareth firſt the in being of one Perſon in another, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10, 11. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>Believe me that I am in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Father in me.</hi> Becauſe a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſignifying both the eſſence and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative property, all the perſons having one and the ſame Eſſence: it followeth, that in reſpect of the Eſſence, one Perſon is in another. Thus <hi>John</hi> ſaith, there are <hi>three;</hi> that is, three diſtinct Perſons, in reſpect of their relative <hi>oppoſition:</hi> adding withal, that <hi>theſe three are one;</hi> namely, in reſpect of the ſameneſs of the Eſſence. And here we may ſee the reaſon of thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.19. <hi>If you had known me, ye ſhould have known my Father alſo: He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That all the Perſons are equal: <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> Phil. 2.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18. Either the Perſons are equal, or elſe becauſe every Perſon is God, there would follow an inequality, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an inferiority in God, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with his Perfection, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That all the Attributes, in that they flow from the Eſſence, are true of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Perſon, becauſe every Perſon hath the whole Eſſence.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98571:20"/>
            <p>Fourthly, That all the Attributes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Relative, Negative, or Poſitive, or if any other, in that they proceed from the Eſſence, are true of every Perſon; becauſe the whole Eſſence is in every Perſon. <hi>The Father is Eternal, the Son is Eternal, the Holy Ghoſt is Eternal,</hi> becauſe the whole Eſſence is in every one of them: <hi>yet there are not three Eternals, but one Eternal;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Eſſence which is in them all, is but one. In like manner, <hi>the Father is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, the Son is infinite, the Holy Ghoſt is infinite; yet, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That all the works of God which concern the Creature, <hi>i. e.</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is beſides God, are wrought by all the Perſons joyntly: becauſe the efficacy whereby they are what they are, proceeds likewiſe from the Eſſence it ſelf, not from the manner of the Eſſence. Moreover, the knowledge of the Trinity is neceſſary to Salvation; becauſe ſaving Faith hath for its object, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and Jeſus Chriſt God-Man.<note place="margin">Note this.</note> No man is ſaved without the knowledge of the Father: <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him,</hi> Joh. 1.18. No man is ſaved without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98571:21"/>of the Son: <hi>Whoſoever denyeth the Son the ſame hath not the Father,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.23. <hi>He that honoureth not the Son, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth not the Father which hath ſent him,</hi> Joh. 5.23. No man is ſaved without the knowledge of the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>Now if any man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>Even the Spirit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you,</hi> Joh. 14.17. God heareth none but ſuch as call upon him in the Name of Chriſt. None can call upon God in Chriſt, but ſuch as are taught and aſſiſted by his Spirit. We cannot Worſhip God aright, without the knowledge of the Trinity. As God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is of the object of Faith; ſo is he of the object of Divine Worſhip, Baptiſm is an act of Worſhip, and ſign of the Covenant; but we are baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. God hath committed all Judgment to the Son; that all men ſhould honour the Son, as they honour the Father. <hi>He that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth not the Son, honoureth not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath ſent him,</hi> Joh. 5.23.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:98571:21"/>
            <p>Believers are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. &amp; 6.19. The Lord of the Temple is worſhipped in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We worſhip the Trinity in Unity, and the Unity in Trinity.</p>
            <p>All Obedience is to be performed unto God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. To him that elected us, that gave Chriſt to redeem us, that created us, that brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that, in a word, doth all for us, is all obedience to be performed. But God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and that as God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, elected us, gave Chriſt to redeem us, created us, &amp;c. Therefore unto God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to be performed.</p>
            <p>The plurality of Perſons in the Trinity, is of great uſe for the confirmation of the truth unto us. <hi>John</hi> aſſerts that great Truth of Jeſus Chriſt being the Son of God, and Saviour of all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; not only from the teſtimony of one God, but from the teſtimony of that one God, who is three Witneſſes; <hi>for there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.7. To the ſame purpoſe is the Argument Chriſt uſeth,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98571:22"/>diſputing againſt the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees; proving the truth of what he had ſpoken concerning himſelf, being the Light of the World, becauſe it was averred by the Father, and him, as two Witneſſes: <hi>It is alſo written in your Law, that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of two men is true: I am one that bear witneſs of my ſelf, and the Father that ſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The knowledge of the Trinity, tends unto the Conſolation of Believers. <hi>Paul</hi> affectionately deſirous that the hearts of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might be comforted, ſheweth two ſpecial means thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Myſtery of God, and of the Father,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Mr.</hi> Norton's <hi>Orthodox Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt.</hi> p. 33, 34.</note> and of Chriſt, with the full aſſurance of underſtanding, and Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-love. Of God; <hi>i. e.</hi> of God, and of his Attributes: of the Father, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Perſons, the firſt of which is the Father: of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> of his Perſon, and Office: ſo ſome, without repugnancy to the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of Faith, or the words of the Text.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The knowledge of the Doctrine of the Trinity, is requiſite to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which (as our Union) is with God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: <hi>And truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.3.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98571:22"/>
               <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt, be with you all, Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.13. Matth. 28.19.</p>
            <p>Though the perfect manner how one Perſon is of another, is incomprehenſible, and unutterable in this life, (the perfect knowledge thereof being reſerved unto glory) yet ſo far hath God revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto us in his Word in this life, as that we may and ought to attain unto ſome diſtinctneſs; yea, unto ſuch diſtinctneſs, as is held forth in the Scriptures of Truth; which is the meaſure of Faith; and not to reſt in an implicite Faith concerning this Myſtery of Myſteries. <hi>Secret things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Lord our God: but theſe things which are revealed belong unto us, and to our Children for ever,</hi> Deut. 29.29. Upon which laſt words, <hi>viz. To us, and to our Children;</hi> they ſay the Hebrew hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Pricks to ſtir up our attention to the matter here ſpoken of. To be wiſe above what is written, is not wiſdom: but perilous ſin and folly. To be wiſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what is written, is ſobriety. To be wiſe up to what is written, (though alas we have all great cauſe to cry, God be merciful to us all herein) is our Duty.</p>

               <q>No where (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the revealed. Will of God, is the truth ſought out with greater labour: no where is our finding out of the truth fruitfuller; no where do we err with greater danger: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.34. <hi>Some have not the knowkedge of God, I ſpeak this to your ſhame,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi>

            <p>To this agrees the ſaying of Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> in his Collections, <hi>pag.</hi> 407, 408. <q>How to conceive of the Deity in our Prayers, in our Meditations, is both the deepeſt Point of all Chriſtianity, and the moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: ſo deep, that if we wade into it, we may eaſily drown, never find the bottom: ſo neceſſary, that without it, our ſelves, our ſervices are prophane, irreligious: We are all born Idolaters, naturally prone to faſhion God to ſome form of our own, whether of an humane body, or of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable light; or if our mind have any other more likely, and pleaſing Image. Firſt then, away with all theſe wicked Thoughts, theſe groſs Devotions; and with <hi>Jacob</hi> burn all your ſtrange Godds under the Oak of <hi>Shechem,</hi> ere you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to ſet up God's Altar at <hi>Bethel:</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98571:23"/>without all mental repreſentations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of your God purely, ſimply, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually; as of an abſolute being, without form, without matter, without compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yea, an infinite, without all limit of thoughts. Let your heart adore a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Majeſty, which it cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, yet knows to be; and as it were, loſe it ſelf in his infiniteneſs. Think of him, as not to be thought of; as one, whoſe Wiſdom is his Juſtice, whoſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is his Power, whoſe Power is his Mercy; and whoſe Wiſdom, Juſtice, Power, Mercy, is himſelf; as without quality good, great without quantity, everlaſting without time, preſent every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where without place, containing all things without extent: And when your thoughts are come to the higheſt, ſtay there, and be content to wonder in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: and if you cannot reach to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him as he is, yet take heed you conceive not of him as he is not. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it ſuffice your Chriſtian mind, to have this awful and confuſed appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Deity, without a more ſpecial and inward conceit of three in this one: Three Perſons in this one Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, not divided, but diſtinguiſhed;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98571:24"/>and not more mingled, than divided. There is nothing, wherein the want of words can wrong and grieve us, but in this: Here alone, as we can adore, and not conceive, ſo we can conceive, and not utter; yea, utter your ſelves, and not be conceived; yet as we may, think here of one ſubſtance in three ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtences; one Eſſence in three Relations; one Jehovah begetting, begotten, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; Father, Son, Spirit: yet ſo, as the Son, is no other thing from the Father, but another Perſon; or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, from the Son. Let your thoughts here walk warily, the path is narrow: the conceit either of three ſubſtances, or but one ſubſiſtence, is damnable. Let me lead you yet higher, and further, in this intricate way, towards the Throne of Grace: All this will not avail you, if you take not your Mediator with you; if you apprehend not a true Manhood, gloriouſly united to the Godhead, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out change of either Nature, without mixture of both; whoſe Preſence, whoſe Merits muſt give paſſage, acceptance, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to your Prayers. Here muſt be therefore (as you ſee) thoughts holily mixed: of a Godhead and Humanity:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98571:24"/>one Perſon in two Natures: of the ſame Deity, in divers Perſons, and one Nature: wherein (if ever) Heavenly Wiſdom muſt beſtir it ſelf, in directing us, ſo to ſever theſe apprehenſions, that none be neglected; ſo to conjoyn them, that they be not confounded. O the depth of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Myſteries, more than can be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at! O the neceſſity of this high Knowledge, which who attains not, may babble, but prayeth not! Still you doubt, and ask if you may not direct your Prayers to one Perſon of three? Why not? ſafely, and with comfort. What need we fear, while we have our Saviour for our pattern? <hi>O my Father (if poſſible) let this Cup paſs:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> everywhere, both in thanks and requeſts; but with due care in Worſhipping all in one. Exclude the other, while you fix your heart upon one, your Prayer is ſin; retain all, and mention one, you offend not: None of them doth ought for us, without all. It is a true rule of Divines: All their external works are common: To ſollicite one therefore, and not all, were injurious. And if you ſtay your thoughts upon the ſacred Humanity of Chriſt, with inſeparable adoration of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98571:25"/>united, and thence climbe up to the holy conceit of that bleſſed and dreadful Trinity, I dare not cenſure, I dare not but commend your divine method. Thus ſhould Chriſtians aſcend from Earth to Heaven, from one Heaven to another. If I have given your Devotions any light, it is well: the leaſt glimpſe of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is worth all the full gleames of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Earthly skill. But I miſtake, if your own heart, wrought upon with ſerious Meditations, (under that Spirit of Illumination) will not prove your beſt maſter. After this weak direction, ſtudy to conceive aright, that you may pray aright; and pray that you may conceive; and meditate, that you may do both: and the God of Heaven direct you, inable you, that you may do all.</q>

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Concerning Chriſt our Mediator.</head>
            <p>I Will now by God's help prove, by the holy Scriptures, that the Eternal Word, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, took fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſo was made
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98571:25"/>like unto his brethren in all things, ſin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. &amp; 4.15. For neither the Father, nor holy Spirit, took our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon them; but Chriſt only. For as by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> came ſin, and death by ſin, even ſo comes grace and life by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. But here we muſt note how Chriſt took Man's Nature upon him. Not by turning his Godhead into his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but by aſſuming of his Manhood into his Godhead; not by confuſion or mixture of ſubſtance, but by unity of Perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. For as the reaſonable Soul and fleſhly body is one Man, even ſo the Deity and Humanity is one Chriſt. When, I ſay, Chriſt took our Nature upon him, I mean not that he took our fleſh only, (as ſome Hereticks have thought) but the Soul of man alſo. Foraſmuch as he is no half-Saviour, but a Redeemer both of Body and Soul; for St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh,</hi> viz. by taking Man's fleſh or Nature in union with the Word, which is Chriſt. And why he is called the Word, I have already ſhewed, and ſhall (God willing) do it again in the <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> about Chriſt, in a place ſet for it; therefore I paſs it over here.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:98571:26"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But the <hi>Eutychians</hi> ask us, <hi>Of what matter the fleſh of Chriſt was made?</hi> Or, <hi>Did he not bring it out of Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No truly; for as the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> fleſh was <hi>made of the Earth,</hi> as it is written, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. Even ſo it is written, <hi>Chriſt was made of a Woman,</hi> Gal. 4.4. for he did not paſs through her as Water through a Pipe, but took part of her ſubſtance; therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>There ſhall come forth a Rod out of the Stem of Jeſſe, and a branch or bloſſome ſhall grow out of his roots, Iſa.</hi> 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.23. And <hi>Solomon</hi> calleth him a Lilly and Roſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.1. Now you know the Flower and the Roſe taketh its nature of the root; For, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>As is the root, ſuch are the branches, Rom.</hi> 11.16, 17. Beſides, it was the Will of God that the ſame fleſh that ſinned ſhould be puniſhed; as we may ſee an inſtance in <hi>Davids</hi> Child; although <hi>David</hi> ſinned in killing of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> yet it pleaſed God to ſpare <hi>Davids</hi> perſon from death, and puniſh him in his fleſh, <hi>viz.</hi> his Child with death. See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Howbeit, becauſe by this deed thou haſt given great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the enemies of the Lord to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, the Child alſo that it born unto thee ſhall ſurely die.</hi> Even ſo, it was <hi>Adam</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:98571:26"/>that ſinned, but it pleaſed God to ſpare his perſon, and puniſh him in his fleſh, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt: For, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was made a Curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. And, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>The juſt ſuffered for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. &amp; 3.18. See the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon alſo betwixt the two <hi>Adams</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Therefore, as by the offence of one, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came upon all men to condemnation; even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life. For as by one man's diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> And thus, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, He is fleſh of our fleſh; <hi>Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame,</hi> Heb. 2.14. For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Verily he took not on him the Nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but he-took on him the Seed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful, and faithful High Prieſt, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the People.</hi> By all which it doth appear, that he took fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> I touch this matter the more, becauſe not long ſince I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with ſome men, who very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98571:27"/>did affirm, that the eternal Word did not take any fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> And they alſo boaſted that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men and Women in <hi>England</hi> of their opinion concerning this matter. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they do grant that Chriſt as Man was really fleſh, yet they deny the matter of which it was made, to be of or from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but ſay that it was Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly matter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine Nature was turned into Fleſh in the Virgins Womb; even as the Water at <hi>Cana</hi> was turned into Wine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.7. Now I will, by God's help, in this enſuing Diſcourſe, demonſtrate the falſhood of this their Opinion: for it denyeth Chriſt to be the true Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> according to the fleſh, contrary to all theſe Texts, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.4. &amp; 22.18. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30. all which prove him to be the true Son of <hi>David</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh. As alſo St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> reckon his kindred and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from <hi>Adam, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> &amp;c. Moreover, Chriſt came not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to die for our ſins, but alſo to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample unto us, and a perfect pattern of good living; as ſhall be declared afterward more fully. For how could he more ſet forth his exceeding love to us, than in dying
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98571:27"/>for us. <hi>For greater love than this hath no man, than to beſtow his life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, ſpeaking of his own death. Now the Deity ſuffered no infirmity, or change, which is impoſſible; wherefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he ſhould take our Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, who came to heal our infirmities, and to teach us to cure them through Faith in well-doing: If he had taken them in any other nature, then the example of his life would not have been teachable unto us; for if he had been tempted in any other nature, or died, how could we learn to withſtand the Devil, and to overcome his temptations by Chriſt's example, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was no way like this to redeem man. He is Wiſdom, therefore he took the wiſeſt way, &amp;c.</p>

And this one God is manifeſted to us by ſuch teſtimonies as cannot deceive, to wit, by Miracles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, and other things which by his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence may be done.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How is God ſaid to be One?</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> Neither by a <hi>genus</hi> nor <hi>ſpecies,</hi> but in Eſſence and in Number, or in regard of his Nature: becauſe there is one only Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and that indiviſible.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Scripture make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Elohim (or) Gods, joyning that word as well with the plural as ſingular number?</hi>

            <p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98571:29"/>but to diſtinguiſh the Perſons: becauſe, though there be one Perſon of the Father, another Perſon of the Son, and another of the holy Ghoſt: yet the Father is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing, or another God diſtinct from the Son and the holy Ghoſt; the Son is not another thing, or another God diſtinct from the Father and the holy Ghoſh: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the holy Ghoſt another thing, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother God diſtinct from the Father and the Son: becauſe the Nature of God is but one and indiviſible, although the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be one, the Son another, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt another. And therefore they are not of divers Natures, of another and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Subſtance, not conjoyned or knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Subſtance, (as men which have one common eſſence); not only of the like ſubſtance, but of one and the ſame ſubſtance, have the ſame Eſſence, the ſame Eternity, the ſame Will, the ſame Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſame Power, and the ſame Glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Three, and thoſe both in number, and in very deed diſtinguiſhed, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and holy Ghoſt: which have their ſubſiſting in one Divine Eſſence: whereupon it comes to paſs, that there be not many Gods, but one God, and the ſame Eternal, Infinite, and Omnipotent, who is named JEHOVAH in the Scriptures: and ſaid to be moſt ſimple by reaſon of Eſſence, and three by reaſon of Perſons.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>By what teſtimonies of the Scripture do you prove the Trinity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Gen. 1.1. God, or <hi>Elohim,</hi> created the Heavens and the Earth. In which place (the Learned ſay) the Verb being of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98571:31"/>ſingular Number, doth ſignifie the moſt ſimple Eſſence of God: and the ſubſtantive <hi>Elohim</hi> being the plural Number, doth note out the three Perſons. Alſo in the creation of Man, God, as it were, taking counſel with his Eternal Wiſdom, that is, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, ſaith thus, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. <hi>Let us make Man after our Image.</hi> Where he ſaith, <hi>Let us make,</hi> becauſe of the number of the Perſons, and <hi>after our Image,</hi> becauſe of the unity of the Eſſence. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24. <hi>The Lord rained from the Lord brimſtone and fire upon Sodom and Gomorrha:</hi> in which place the Perſon ſending the rain, and the Perſon from whom it was ſent, (that is the Son) is diſtinguiſhed from the Father.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Have you any more pregnant proofs out of the New Teſtament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In the Baptiſm of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.32. the voice of the Father is heard from heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son:</hi> In the ſame place there ſtands the Son, by the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> the holy Ghoſt deſcends in the form of a Dove and ſits on Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Again, in the Transfiguration, there is the Son, and the voice of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is heard from Heaven, and Chriſt is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98571:32"/>ſhadowed with a Cloud, which doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Holy Ghoſt. And further, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Baptize all Nations in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> He ſaith not <hi>Names,</hi> but in the <hi>[Name]</hi> to ſhew the unity of the three Perſons. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Seeing the Scripture doth not uſe the Name of the Trinity, doth the Church well to retain the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea no doubt: for the thing it ſelf is found in Scripture two manner of wayes: firſt, according to the letter: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, according to the ſenſe. Now fith that the ſenſe of it, and the very thing it ſelf is found in the Scriptures, the Church hath liberty to uſe ſuch words as may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly expreſs the thing it ſelf. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we call the three Perſons in God, the Trinity, from this word <hi>Three,</hi> whereof the word <hi>Trinity</hi> is derived, and is expreſly ſet down, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>There be three that bear Witneſs in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt: and theſe Three are One.</hi> Whence we argue, That as from One comes Unity, ſo from Three comes Trinity.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:98571:32"/>
            <p>Q. <hi>How doth this word Eſſence differ from the word Perſon in God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Eſſence is the Nature which is not more belonging to one, and leſs to another of the three Perſons, but common to them all; yea, one and the ſame, and cannot be divided, and is all in each one of them, not without them, ſubſiſting by it ſelf, to wit, the very Deity it ſelf. And therefore the Eſſential Properties which be in them, are one in Number, and of one Nature. Now a Perſon is the ſubſiſting in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, or the Nature of God, which having relation to others, is diſtinguiſhed by ſome incommunicatable Property: for indeed the Perſons are only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, and not ſervered; as three men are indeed ſeparated, though they be but one in kind. The reaſon is becauſe the Eſſence of God is infinite and impartible, and therefore it is all in every Perſon, which are not ſevered each from other, but only diſtinguiſhed amongſt themſelves. (But as for the Eſſence of Angels and Men, it is finite and partible, ſo that it is not all in eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y ſingular Perſon, but part in one and part in another.)</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How many-fold is the difference of Perſons?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:98571:33"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Twofold: inward, and outward. The inward difference is that which is cauſed by the internal Properties, or the works from within: concerning which we ſay, the works of the Trinity from within are divided: that is the works which God doth within himſelf, without any Creature are not common to the three Perſons, but are proper to one Perſon alone. Now the Property of the Father is this,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.5. Heb. 1.3, 5 Prov. 8.24.</note> that he was not made not begotten, but hath begotten his Eternal Son of the ſame ſubſtance with himſelf. The Property of the Son is this, that he being neither made nor created, but was from all Eternity begotten of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without any Mother; who is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as he is God;<note place="margin">Heb. 7.3. Col. 1.15.</note> but of his Father as he is the Son. For as Light cometh from the Sun, even ſo the Son proceedeth from the Father; one diſtinct from the Father, and therefore the ſecond in order,<note place="margin">Pſal 110.3 Mic. 5.2.</note> ſo far forth as he is begotten: one and the ſelf-ſame with the Father as he is God. And here let us call to mind the ſaying of <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene;</hi> The begetting of God, let it be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with ſilence: it is no ſmall matter for thee to learn that he was begotten. The Property of the Holy Ghoſt is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from them both inſeparably.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:98571:33"/>
            <p>Q. <hi>But did the Son take his Deity from the Father?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> When we ſpeak ſimply of the Son without the Father, we avouch truly and properly that he is of himſelf, and call him God, becauſe of himſelf he hath his being, and all that he hath;<note place="margin">Joh. 14 25 &amp; 15.26. &amp; 16.13, 14. Rom. 8.9.</note> and therefore we call him one alone beginning. But when we point at that relation which he hath with his Father, we juſtly make the Father the beginning of the Son, and ſay that the Son received all from the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. For the Eſſence is one thing, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Subſiſting is another. Hence it is that the Schoolmen ſay, That the Son is by himſelf, not of himſelf. So the Eſſence of the Son is without beginning, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the beginning of his Perſon. This made <hi>Hilary</hi> to ſay; <hi>The gifts of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do not infirm but affirm the Divinity of the Son.</hi> And <hi>Auguſtine, Chriſt in regard of himſelf, is called God; and of the Father, is called the Son:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. 1. <hi>The Son and Holy Ghoſt are not without beginning, therefore they are not Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This is not a beginning of time or continuance, but only of order and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:98571:34"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But the <hi>Sabellians</hi> here cavil, and ſay Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that ſeeth me, ſeeth the Father: and believeſt thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? Joh.</hi> 14.9, 10. Therefore the Father and the Son are one Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Indeed he that ſeeth the Son ſeeth the Father, becauſe the Son hath the ſame Eſſence with the Father, and being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh, hath delivered to us the whole Will of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p>Object. 3. <hi>That which is one in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, cannot without contradiction be ſaid to be Three in Perſons: but God is One in Number,</hi> (Deut. 6.4.) <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That Unity doth ſignifie God's ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Eſſence, not the manner by which that ſimple Eſſence ſubſiſteth. Therefore God abſolutely according to his Eſſence is One, becauſe he is indiviſible: And only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of inward relation, I mean the reaſon of ſubſiſting, is three.</p>
            <p>Obj. 4. <hi>If there be one being of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghoſt: it followeth, that in God there are three divers Beings, and conſequently three divers Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The being of the Father doth not ſignifie that Eſſence by which he is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98571:34"/>God, but by which he is Father, that is, in that he otherwiſe ſubſiſteth than doth the Son: therefore the being of the Father is one thing, and the being of the Son is another, and yet both of them have the ſame Eſſence.</p>
            <p>Obj. 5. <hi>If there be three Perſons truly diſtinguiſhed, and one only Eſſence, then is there a quaternity in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not ſo: for the Eſſence differeth from Perſon only in reaſon: but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons differ each from other both in reaſon and in being.</p>
            <p>Obj. 6. <hi>The Father begot his Son either exiſting or not exiſting; to ſay either of theſe is abſurd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We may well ſay, That the Father begat his Son already exiſting, becauſe the Father was never without the Son, even as the Sun was never without its Light. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it may be as well ſaid, That he begat him not exiſting, in that his generation, although it be Eternal, yet in order goeth before Exiſtence, as the Sun is before its Light.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Is this difference Rational, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, or Real?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not Eſſential, as in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where every one hath his proper
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98571:35"/>Eſſence or Being, defined and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: for the Eſſence of the Father is not one, and the Eſſence of the Son ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Holy Ghoſt another, but one and the ſame, which the Father doth wholly communicate to the Son, the Father and the Son to the holy Ghoſt. Not only in reaſon, becauſe not in notion, or mind, or only in word is he called Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: neither reſpectively or by relation; as one man may both be, and be called a Father and a Son: But it is real, or modal, yet altogether incomprehenſible, becauſe each Perſon hath his own peculiar definition, or his eſſential and incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable property, and differs from another not in eſſence, but in the manner of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the outward difference?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is taken from the works of God that be without, as that the Father ſends the Son, the Son is ſent as the Redeemer; the Holy Ghoſt is the Sanctifier. As in the Creed, the Father is diſtinguiſhed from the Son by the work of Creation, the Son by his Incarnation, the Holy Ghoſt from them both, by the work of Sanctification and Regeneration; as where he appeared like as a Dove, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 3.) and in cloven
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98571:35"/>Tongues, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Although all theſe things be effected by one and the ſelf-ſame God. As we uſe to ſay, The works of the Trinity without are indiviſible: therefore here let us remember the ſaying of <hi>Gregory Nazianzene:</hi> 
               <q>I cannot imagine one, but preſently I am compaſſed about on every ſide with the brightneſs of three: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I diſtinguiſh three, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I am brought again to one. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Perſons of the Deity there is an order, but there is none inequality: there is a diſtinction, but no diverſity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What things are contrary to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Hereſie of <hi>Sabellias,</hi> who taught there was only one Perſon of the Godhead, but ſometimes in one reſpect, ſometimes in another, one while called the Father, another while called the Son.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of <hi>Samoſatenus,</hi> who taught, That the Son did no more ſubſiſt in God, than Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of <hi>Arrius,</hi> who denyed that the Son was begotten of the Eſſence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he was co-eternal, co-equal, and according to his Perſon of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of <hi>Servetus,</hi> who affirmed that the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98571:36"/>word <hi>Perſon</hi> is no otherwiſe to be taken, then as in Comedies the name of a Perſon is uſed for the habit and the diſtinction of the office.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Of the <hi>Tritheitarites,</hi> who do trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the three Perſons into three diſtinct and ſeveral Eſſences: They deny the Son of God according to his Eſſence, to be of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father, and the Son to be God of himſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The blindneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who do affirm an Eſſence altogether without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. And here I will Anſwer to ſome Objections made by divers Hereticks.</p>
            <p>Object. 1. <hi>If there be divers Jehovahs, there muſt be divers Eſſences: but</hi> (Gen. 19.24.) <hi>the firſt is true: for Jehovah did rain fire from Jehovah: that is, the Son from the Father: therefore the Son is a diſtinct Eſſence from the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Learned ſay, it is an Hebrew phraſe, ſignifying that God did miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly rain fire of himſelf, from Heaven. Again, the word <hi>Jehovah</hi> is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perſonally, it is therefore a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Perſons, not in Eſſence.</p>
            <p>Obj. 2. <hi>There is one life of the Father, and another of the Son,</hi> Joh. 5.26. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another Eſſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:98571:36"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, that place is to be underſtood of a power communicated to Chriſt as he was Mediator. Secondly, Although the Son be from the Father, in reſpect of the origination of his Perſon, yet is he of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he be abſolutely conſidered, and therefore hath the ſame life with the Father.</p>
            <p>Obj. 3. <hi>They who have diſtinct Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have diſtinct Eſſences: but the Actions of the Trinity are diſtinct; Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Propoſition is true, if it be underſtood of natural and external action: but if of internal and perſonal actions it is not true; for theſe do not take away the unity of Eſſence; ſince that the ſame Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in number is wholly in every Perſon.</p>
            <p>Obj. 4. <hi>Each Perſon hath not one and the ſame power, for the Father can beget the Son, the Son cannot beget; ergo they have not the ſame Eſſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They have all one natural power, but not perſonally; as there is one Nature, but not one Perſon.</p>
            <p>Obj. 5. <hi>The Eſſence of the Father is communicated to the Son by Generation; therefore there is one Eſſence in the Father, another in the Son, becauſe there is one Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence begetting, and another begotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98571:37"/>and Communication; for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon begets and is begotten, but the Eſſence neither begetteth nor is begotten, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</p>
            <p>Obj. 6. <hi>If the Father and Son have one Eſſence, it muſt follow, that the Father was incarnate, which is abſurd; Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Eſſence of God abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered was not incarnate, but the ſecond Perſon: and although the Perſon of the Son include the whole Eſſence of God, yet for the proper manner of ſubſiſting, it is diſtinguiſhed from the Father.</p>
            <p>Obj. 7. <hi>If the Father and Son have one Eſſence, the Son ſhould be Mediator to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Son is properly Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and his Father, not abſolutely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and the Divine Eſſence. And the office of Mediator dependeth upon the moſt free Ordination of God.<note place="margin">Note.</note>

               <hi>A.</hi> This word <hi>concrete,</hi> in the diſcourſe of Chriſt, is ſaid to be that which ſignifieth the nature together with the ſubject, and doth comprehend in his ſignification both the thing, and the ſubject wherein the thing is, (that is to ſay), it doth define the Perſon of Chriſt, as he is the Son of God; becauſe the Son of God doth not ſimply ſignifie the Nature of God, but the Perſon of the Son of God; So the Son of Man,<note place="margin">See <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi> Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. loc. <hi>2.</hi> or pag. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note> when it is ſpoken of Chriſt, ſignifieth the Perſon, and not his Humanity ſimply. But this name <hi>abſtract,</hi> is a word that ſignifieth the Nature ſimply: as the Divinity of Chriſt, the Humanity of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>Q. 4. <hi>How many things are eſpecially neceſſary to know Chriſt, and which be they?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Two: his Perſon, and his Office.</p>
            <p>Q. 5. <hi>What is Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Q. 6. <hi>What things are we eſpecially to conſider in the Perſon of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Four: 1. That Chriſt is God. 2. That the ſame Chriſt is Man. 3. That he is God and Man in one Perſon. 4. The Phraſes and the uſual Speeches which are affirmed of Chriſt in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Q. 7. <hi>By how many, and by what kind of teſtimonies do you prove that Chriſt is God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By three: 1. By apparent and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſentences of Scripture, wherein the Divinity of Chriſt is averred. 2. By his Works, which were altogether Divine. 3. By the worſhip and honour which was yielded unto Chriſt, both of the Saints
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98571:38"/>that believed, and of the Angels.</p>
            <p>Q. 8. <hi>Shew ſome pregnant teſtimonies whereby you can prove that Chriſt is God.</hi>

            <p>Q. 9. <hi>Which be the teſtimonies of the ſecond ſort?</hi>

            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:98571:39"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The works which none can do <hi>but God</hi> alone, which are aſcribed to him, to wit, to create and preſerve, to redeem, to blot out iniquities, to ſearch the heart, to hear our prayers, to quicken, to judge; moreover, the Miracles which he wrought by his own power, according to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5, 6. unto which alſo even Chriſt himſelf ſendeth us, and for the working whereof he gave power to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; moreover, thoſe Attributes which do agree only to the Nature of God, and aſcribed unto him; as <hi>Eternal, Almighty, Infinite, King of Kings, Saviour,</hi> and the reſt, teſtifie him to be God by Nature.

            <p>Q. <hi>What is the third kind of teſtimonies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The worſhip and honour which is performed unto Chriſt, namely, Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Adoration, Faith, Hope. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.11. <hi>All the Kings of the Earth ſhall worſhip him, &amp; all People ſhall ſerve him,</hi> Iſa. 11.10.

            <p>Q. <hi>Why is it neceſſary that Chriſt the Redeemer ſhould be God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For two cauſes eſpecially, whereof of former is the greatneſs of the evil wherewith all mankind was overwhelmed, which could be taken away by no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: The later is the greatneſs of the good,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.17.</note> which could be reſtored by none to man again, but by God, who alone is truly good.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the greatneſs of the evil?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It ſtandeth in Four things, which be theſe; The greatneſs of man's ſin, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and unſupportable weight of God's anger; the power of Death; the tyranny of the Devil; which to take away, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh, to appeaſe, to overcome, none was able but God alone.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the greatneſs of the good, which could be reſtored by no creature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The reſtoring again of the Image
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98571:40"/>of God: therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> (1 Cor. 1.31.) <hi>is made to us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Redemption;</hi>

            <p>Q. <hi>Why is he called the Word?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe it is he that ſpake the Word, and all things were made.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>According to which Nature is he called the Image of God?</hi> Col. 1.15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not according to his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone, as man is ſaid to be made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image of God; but eſpecially ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Divine Nature, but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> or ſo far forth as God hath truly manifeſted himſelf in Chriſt: whereupon he is called, <hi>The brightneſs of the Glory of the Father,</hi> Heb. 1.3. and <hi>the Character</hi> or ingraven form <hi>of his Perſon;</hi> becauſe he is not ſome <hi>vaniſhing</hi> repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ingraven and durable.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Prove that Chriſt is very Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I will; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. The Seed of the Woman is promiſed, which ſhall break the Serpents head. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.17. God promiſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in his Seed all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed. 3 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12. It is promiſed to <hi>David,</hi> that his Son muſt ſit upon his Throne and Reign for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98571:40"/>ever. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall Conceive and bring forth a Son.</hi> Beſides all this, the Hiſtory of the Goſpel doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove that Chriſt was conceived, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 1.31. &amp; 2.7. — 21. &amp; 22.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38. &amp; 4.2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.29. &amp; 19.34. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.50. &amp; 9.36. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.17. &amp; 11.33, 35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.37, 38. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9, 11.</note> born, circumciſed, had a true Body and Soul, was hungry, thirſty, ſhed his blood, that he died, and that he had all the Properties and Affections of man's Nature, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, that he aſcended viſibly and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally into Heaven, and thence that he ſhall come again to Judgment.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why muſt Chriſt needs become Man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Juſtice of God required it ſhould be ſo, that the diſobedience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in our fleſh, might in the ſame be repaired, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17, 18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The reaſon of our Adoption: for it pleaſed the Son of God to take the Nature of Man upon him, and to become our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo by that means to become our neareſt kinſman, and moſt near allied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that we being made his members, might be made the Sons of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. and that he might have right to redeem and ranſom us. Hence is matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98571:41"/>in every kind of temptation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Heb. 2. 17. &amp; 4.5. ſaith, <hi>He took not upon him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> and in all things became like to his brethren, that he might have compaſſion of his brethren.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the confirmation of our Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: for in that Chriſt took on him our Nature, and hath raiſed it up, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto it immortality, and hath exalted it in Heaven: by vertue of that Communion (which we have with him) ſhall we be raiſed up at the laſt day, and this our vile body ſhall be made conformable to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>As in Adam all are dead, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why was neither the Father nor the Holy Ghoſt incarnate, but the Son?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. Becauſe it was meet that the World ſhould be redeemed, and all things reſtored by him, by whom all things were created; or, that man ſhould be redeemed from death by him, by whom he was firſt created, and ſhould have been brought unto life eternal if he had not ſinned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It would have been unconvenient, that there ſhould <hi>be two</hi> Sons; one in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98571:41"/>Divine Nature, another in the Humane Nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was the Eternal Decree of the Father, whereby he purpoſed to ſave man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by his Son. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Whether is Chriſt God and Man, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided or joyned together?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Joyned and uniced, but not divided.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>By what kind of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not by inhabitation only, as God dwelleth in the Saints;<note place="margin">Joh. 17.21.</note> not by conſent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Faithful are one in the Father and the Son: not by Mixture, as when Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is mingled with Wine; not by Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as two boards be joyned together: laſtly, not by Compoſition, whereby of the mixture of two things, there ariſeth a third: but by Perſonal Union, which (as it's ſaid) the <hi>Greeks</hi> call Incorporation, becauſe neither the whole Deity, nor any part of it, is ſubjectively communicated to the Humanity of Chriſt, but only the Humane Nature was aſſumed of the Son of God into the ſame Perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion in Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is that whereby the Perſon of the Son of God, being a Perſon from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity exiſting, did aſſume the moſt pure Nature of Man, wanting all perſonal
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98571:42"/>exiſting of its own, into the unity of his Perſon, and made it his own, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of each Nature being preſerved. Or, as <hi>Paul</hi> defines it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. whereby in Chriſt doth dwell all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily; whereof we have a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt reſemblance in the union of the Soul and the body; And therefore the Apoſtle doth well call it a great Myſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How is this Union made?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Without all confuſion, Without all converſion of one Nature into another, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibly, inſeparably. The difference of the Natures by no means being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the union: but rather the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of either Nature being ſaved, and joyned together, or concurring into one Perſon, and one ſubſiſting, as the <hi>Calcedon</hi> Synod ſpeak in the Hiſtory of <hi>Evagrius, lin.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. And from that time that the Word did aſſume our Humane Nature, he never left it, no not in his death. And to this purpoſe make theſe Verſes; <hi>I am that I was, not I was that I am, now both am I called; Thou knoweſt me not, except thou know me ſubſiſting of both Natures.</hi> — See Mr. <hi>John Tombes</hi> his Expoſition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Calcedon</hi>-Council concerning the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98571:42"/>two Natures in Chriſt aſſerted, in his Book, intituled <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> or, <hi>God-man. Sect.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>By what teſtimonies will you prove, that the Divine and Humant Nature in Chriſt, did joyn together in one and the ſame Perſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Iſa. 7.14. &amp; 9.6. Luk. 1.35. <hi>That which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> Joh. 1.14. <hi>And the Word was made Fleſh:</hi> not by Sacramental-union, in which reſpect Chriſt was ſaid to be a Rock: not by confuſion of the Natures: nor by commutation, as Water is turned into Wine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.14. but by aſſuming the fleſh into the unity of this Perſon. The Voice of God ſpeaketh thus of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of <hi>Mary: This is my beloved Son,</hi> Matth. 3.17. <hi>He that deſcended is even the ſelf-ſame that aſcended above all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, that he might fill all things,</hi> Eph. 4.10. <hi>God ſent his Son, born of a Woman,</hi> Gal. 4.4.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why is it neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould be both God and Man in one and the ſame Perſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. To die end he might reconcile God and Man, or that he might make God and Man one.</p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:98571:43"/>
            <p n="2">2. That he might be a fit Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Men,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.5 Heb. 8 6</note> by reaſon of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation and Affinity with them both.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he might reconcile God unto us by his death, which if he had been God alone, he could never have ſuffered; if only Man, he could never have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the work of Redemption per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the fleſh of the Son, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of ſufficient price for ſin, whereby God, that infinite good, was offended. For, although certain actions do properly proceed from the Divine Nature, and ſome are done by the Humane Nature, yet all of them do equally receive their price and worthineſs from the Divine Nature. So the fleſh of Chriſt hath power to quicken, becauſe it is the fleſh of that Perſon who is God: the obedience of the Man Chriſt doth Juſtifie, becauſe it is the obedience of that Perſon who is God: the blood of Chriſt redeems the Church, <hi>becauſe it is the blood of God,</hi> Acts 20.28.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is the Communication of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is ſuch a manner of Predication, whereby thoſe things which be proper to Natures are indifferently attributed to the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98571:43"/>Perſon of Chriſt which is but one: and that becauſe Chriſt in his two Natures is both, to wit, perfect God, and perfect Man; to whom therefore theſe things are truly and indeed attributed, as well thoſe which are proper to God, as thoſe which be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Man. Therefore it is well and truly ſaid; God, or elſe the Son of God, was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſuffered, was crucified; and <hi>God purchaſed unto himſelf the Church with his own blood,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. Acts. 20.28. Not ſimply, principally, and by himſelf, as he is God, but by accident, and in another reſpect, or in regard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing: becauſe that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to one Nature, namely, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived born, crucified, to die, is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his Divinity, but to the Perſon taking the name of one, namely, of the Divine Nature. For this word, <hi>the Son of God,</hi> or <hi>God</hi> (which is the ſubject of the Propoſition) is the <hi>concrete</hi> and not the <hi>abſtract,</hi> and ſignifieth not the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the Perſon, who is God and Man. Therefore it is well ſaid; The Son of Man, or Chriſt-Man is Eternal, Almighty, All-preſent; ſaveth, raiſeth the dead, giveth Eternal Life. And, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13. <hi>No man hath aſcended into Heaven, but he that came
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98571:44"/>down from Heaven:</hi> both in reſpect of the Union, ſeeing that the ſelf-ſame Perſon is both Man and God: for as God, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the unity, doth account thoſe things which belong to the Humane Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to himſelf; ſo as he is Man, by reaſon of the union, doth account thoſe things which belong to the Divine Nature to be proper to it ſelf: and alſo becauſe the Son of Man is a word <hi>concrete,</hi> which ſignifies the Perſon of Chriſt, being but one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the Divine and Humane Nature; and therefore whole <hi>Chriſt</hi> is every where preſent, but not all that is in Chriſt. On the contrary, it is wickedly ſaid, That the Divinity of Chriſt was born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, ſuffered death, and that the Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt is Eternal, every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, Almighty; for the Divinty is a word <hi>abſtract,</hi> which ſimply ſignifieth the Divine Nature in Chriſt, which is moſt free from all manner of ſufferings. Now the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of divers Natures by reaſon of the Hypoſtatical (or Perſonal) Union, is of no force, but in thoſe things which are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified as whole and perfect: for as we do not uſe to ſay, the Body is the Soul, or the Man is the Soul: ſo neither do we ſay, this God (Chriſt) is the Body of Chriſt,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98571:44"/>or the Soul of Chriſt, but only God is Man.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> It is a true and real ſpeech, becauſe the Perſon of whom, by the trope <hi>Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi> as well the Divine as the Humane, either names of Proprieties, or Effects, are indifferent and equally affirmed, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all thoſe things in it ſelf truly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which do agree to very God, and very Man: thoſe things which be Divine; as he is God: thoſe alſo which be Humane as the ſame is Man, but not in reſpect of both Natures, but according to the one and the other.

            <p>Q. <hi>But thoſe Titles which belong to the Office of Redemption, are they to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Natures ſeverally aſunder, or to the Perſon?</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The beſtowing of gifts, whereby the Humane Nature in the Perſon of Chriſt is adorned, and whereby it excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all other Creatures in Wiſdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Holineſs, Power, Majeſty, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; which the old Fathers call the Deify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Fleſh: the Schoolmen, Habitual Grace, of the Communion of Properties (which is mutual one of another, and the reciprocation of the Names) altogether diſtinct.</p>
            <p>Q <hi>How manifold is the ſtate of Chriſt?</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> Two-fold: one of Humiliation, whereby he willingly undergoing the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, reproaches and puniſhments of our Nature, did humble himſelf to the death of the Croſs; the Divinity in the mean while (according to <hi>Irenaeus</hi>) reſting or hiding it ſelf, that he might be crucified, and die. The other, of Exhaltation, whereby after his death, his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did lay aſide all the infirmities of it, (but not the Eſſential Properties) and was wonderfully exalted above all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures unto the greateſt honour, yet not in any caſe match'd, and equalled to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 9.</p>

            <p>Q. <hi>What are the Doctrines contrary to this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The firſt Hereſie of <hi>Macedonius</hi> and <hi>Valentinus,</hi> who affirmed, That Chriſt brought with him a Celeſtial body from Heaven: As alſo of <hi>Apelles,</hi> who ſaid, His Body was aiery, his Fleſh ſtar-like, and that he paſſed from the <hi>Virgin</hi> as Water from a Pipe.</p>

            <p n="4">4. Of <hi>Eunomius,</hi> who affirmed Chriſt to be meer man, and that he was called the Son of God by Adoption: And of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5.

Therefore he denyed that <hi>Mary</hi> was the Mother of God, or brought forth God; and affirmed, that Man, not God, was crucified of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="6">6. <hi>Eutyches</hi> Hereſie, contrary to the former: for he taught that the Humane Nature after the Union, was indued with the properties of the Divinity, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Divine Nature was turned into fleſh.)</p>
            <p n="7">7. Of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who avouched that Chriſt had but one only Will; and not two, a Divine, and a Humane Will.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitaries,</hi> who attribute to the Humanity of Chriſt the Eſſential properties of the Divinity, altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that ſaying, He that taketh away the Properties, taketh away the Nature: and on the contrary, He that attributeth the Proprieties, attributeth the Nature: and of whatſoever the Eſſence cannot be affirmed, no more can the Eſſential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties thereof be affirmed of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now I have here briefly given you an account of theſe Eight Opinions about Chriſt as aforeſaid. And by theſe you ſee St. <hi>Peters</hi> words fulfilled, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the People, even as there ſhall be falſe Teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable HERESIES, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction. And many ſhall follow
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98571:46"/>their pernitious wayes, by reaſon of whom the way of Truth ſhall be evil ſpoken of. Acts</hi> 20.28. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Take head therefore unto your ſelves, and unto all the Flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood: for I know this, that after my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſhall grievous Wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the Flock; alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.21. ſaith, That <hi>Manaſſes</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and both againſt <hi>Judah.</hi> Alſo <hi>Herod</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Pilat,</hi> and <hi>Pilat</hi> againſt <hi>Herod,</hi> and both againſt <hi>Christ:</hi> even ſo, here is the <hi>Eunomians,</hi> (or <hi>Socinians,</hi> or <hi>Bidelians</hi>) againſt the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> and both againſt <hi>Christ;</hi> for the one denyeth his Divine Nature, and the other his Humane, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.45. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16. <hi>I am the root and off-ſpring of David;</hi> and ſo by conſequence both deny the true Chriſt. For the Devil knoweth there is no Salvation for us without Faith in him who is <hi>David</hi>'s Lord, and <hi>David</hi>'s Son. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is none other Name under heaven
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98571:47"/>given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved, Acts</hi> 4.12. And now, Brethren, that I may, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts.</hi> 20.26. be clear from the blood of you all: for I have and will declare unto you all the counſel of God (that I know) touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter; but as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. So ſay I, for we know in part, and we propheſie in part; for now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then ſhall I know even as alſo I am known. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. Ye therefore beloved, ſeeing ye know theſe things before, beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the Error of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For ſome of you have been as brands pluck'd out of the fire, <hi>Jude</hi> 23. (I mean out of the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Hereſie,) which doth not only deny Chriſt to be truly <hi>David's</hi> Son, but ſaith, That he that was truly <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Lord and Creator was mortal and died, contrary to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Now unto the King Eternal, Immortal, Inviſible, the only Wiſe God be honour and glory for ever and ever, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now becauſe the right knowledge of Chriſt, and union of his Natures, is ſo abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, I will
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98571:47"/>add ſome Queſtions, and propound them for the <hi>Eutychians</hi> conſideration.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Containing Queſtions &amp; Anſwers about the Union of Natures in Chriſt.</head>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>WHy must Christ become Man and take our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> viz. <hi>the fleſh of the Virgin Mary?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe the Juſtice of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that ſeeing in that Nature God was offended, in that Nature ſhould a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction be made to God for the offence. Now ſin was committed in Man's Nature, <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned firſt, and in him all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; therefore Chriſt took Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſo he might ſuffer death, and ſo make ſatisfaction to his Father for Men's ſins.</p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>Is there no way appointed of God to remit our ſins, but by ſhedding of blood?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No, ſo ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Without ſhedding of blood, there is no remiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 3. <hi>Can Chriſt, conſidered as he is the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98571:48"/>Eternal Word</hi> (Joh. 1.1.) <hi>and very God</hi> (1 Joh. 5.20.) <hi>die?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No: for God is immortal and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. for he only is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning and without end.</p>
            <p>Q. 4. <hi>But although God as God cannot die, yet cannot he change himſelf from a Creator to a Creature, and ſo die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No: for ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not.</hi> Jam. 1.17. <hi>Neither is there any ſhadow of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 5. <hi>Did Chriſt take our fleſh, and not our ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes: for the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>He was made like unto his brethren in all things, ſin only excepted,</hi> Heb. 2.17. &amp; 4.15.</p>
            <p>Q. 6. <hi>How could he take our fleſh, and not our ſin alſo, ſith all other men partake of both?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> All other men came from <hi>Adam,</hi> and by <hi>Adam</hi> as a procreant cauſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. but Chriſt came from <hi>Adam,</hi> but not by <hi>Adam,</hi> viz. being made of a Woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. (even as <hi>Eve</hi> was made of a Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.) but not begotten as <hi>Cain,</hi> and all other men are, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p>Q. 7. <hi>How could Chriſt properly be the Son of Man, and ſo the Son of David, and of Abraham, and Adam, if he did not take
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98571:48"/>the very fleſh and blood of the Virgin Mary, the Daughter of David, as St.</hi> Luke, <hi>in his third Chapter, ſaith ſhe was?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He could not: for God had ſworn with an oath to him, That of the fruit of this Loyns according to the fleſh, he would raiſe up Chriſt to ſit on his Throne, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30.</p>
            <p>Q. 8. <hi>If ſo; whether then is not that Opinion heretical and damnable that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth Chriſt to be the true Son of David?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is; becauſe there is no Eternal Salvation to be had in any other, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39.</p>
            <p>Q. 9. <hi>Whether if Chriſt had been a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only, although an Angel or Man, could he have overcome death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No: for, as he was Man, the <hi>Jews</hi> did deſtroy the temple of his body, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. but, as God, he raiſed it up again the third day, as he told the <hi>Jews</hi> he would do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18.</p>
            <p>Q. 10. <hi>Whether if Death and the Grave had kept Chriſt Priſoner for ever; could any have been ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No; ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>For then they which are aſleep in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 11. <hi>Whether doth not this abſurdity
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98571:49"/>follow the</hi> Eutychian <hi>Opinion, that if Chriſt be only God, then he could not die, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; if only Man, then he cannot raiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the dead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It doth unavoidably follow upon their Opinion.</p>
            <p>Q 12. <hi>Whether ſuch a Doctrine, which by its natural conſequences maketh the death and reſurrection of Chriſt impoſſible or elſe in vain, ought not to be abandoned by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, doubtleſs it ought; for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the Faith of Gods Elect utterly, if believed.</p>
            <p>Q. 13. <hi>What muſt we do with thoſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that are ignorant of theſe bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences as aforeſaid?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Inſtruct them in the true Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt's death and reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Q. 14. <hi>But what muſt we do if they be obſtinate, and will not repent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Then after the firſt and ſecond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, reject them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10.</p>
            <p>Q. 15. <hi>If Chriſt before he came from Heaven, was of the uncreated ſubſtance of the Father, their Eſſence being One; then will it not follow that the Father was made fleſh at well as the Sou, ſith you ſay it was the Eſſence that was made fleſh, not the Perſon
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98571:49"/>of the Son took it into Perſonal Union, as we with the Scriptures ſay he did,</hi> Heb. 2.14, 16.</p>
            <p>Q. 16. <hi>If it were poſſible for the uncreated ſubſtance to make it ſelf into Fleſh, which by nature is a Spirit, and ſpiritual ſubſtance,</hi> Joh. 4.24. <hi>Then how could he receive nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from the Virgin, as you ſay he did, and grow in her womb?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 17. <hi>If he be of the uncreated ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, how could he grow in Wiſdom as he did, ſith the uncreated ſubſtance is wiſdom it ſelf,</hi> Prov. 8.</p>
            <p>Q. 18. <hi>If Chriſt be only of the uncreated ſubſtance, then how could he be ignorant of the day of Judgment?</hi> Mark 13.32.</p>
            <p>Q 19. <hi>If he was only of the uncreated ſubſtance; then how could he be anointed by the Holy Ghost?</hi> Luk. 4.18. Acts 4.27.</p>
            <p>Q. 20. <hi>If he be only of the uncreated ſubſtance, then whoſe Will did he obey, when he ſaid, Not my Will, but thy Will be done?</hi> Luk. 22.42. <hi>For the Eſſence is one in the Father, and the Son,</hi> Joh. 14.9, 11.</p>
            <p>Q. 21. <hi>Why did Christ die, as you ſay he did, if he was only of the uncreated ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? Did he die to ſatisfie himſelf,</hi> viz. <hi>as God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer fairly, and do not now (when you ſee all theſe groſs abſurdities follow
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98571:50"/>your Opinion (as the natural conſequences of it) ſay; you cannot tell what he was before he was made fleſh in the Virgins womb; for then you worſhip you know not what, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.22. with the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and ſo you are Idolaters as they and the <hi>Athenians</hi> were, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.22, 23, &amp;c.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Some Objections.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Peradventure ſome may ſay, <hi>Theſe abſurdities will follow upon your own Opinion as well as ours, for you ſay he was God by Nature as well as we; and there is but one God by Nature,</hi> Gal. 4.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Not ſo; for we alwayes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt the Eſſence of the Son, and the Perſon, ſaying, The Eſſence is one with his Father, but not his Perſon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſay his Perſon was begotten, not his Eſſence: and we alſo ſay, that his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon took Fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> not the Eſſence: and therefore it was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Son that was born of her, not the Father, nor the Spirit: for although the Eſſence of the three be one, yet the Perſons be diſtinct, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. So that the Eternal Word, the Son of God, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pray to his Father (as I remember) till he became our Mediator, no more than the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98571:50"/>Holy Ghoſt doth pray to the Father, which for himſelf you know he doth not: but Chriſt did pray for himſelf, which could not be for his Godhead, but for his Manhood, which is a Creature, and therefore ought to perform homage to God the Creator. For we alwayes diſtinguiſh betwixt the Natures (which you deny) therefore we ſay it was his Humane Nature that was ignorant of the day of Judgment; for with his Divine Nature he knoweth all things, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.25. And by virtue of it he could and did forgive ſins; which two things, viz. <hi>To ſearch the heart,</hi> and and <hi>to forgive ſins,</hi> none but God can do; therefore we cannot conceive how he could become our Saviour, and Mediator, except he had theſe two Natures in one Perſon: for if he had not took our Nature, and ſo appeared before God in our ſtead, <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſins in his own body,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 Pet. 2.24. And ſo St. <hi>Paul.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Was made ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. for elſe Juſtice could not have puniſhed him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he had been put to death in the fleſh, which we ſay only died (which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction you deny); but we, with St.

For as the typical Lamb was without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, even ſo was Chriſt, ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. &amp; 2.24. Secondly, The Prieſt was ſanctified, or ſet apart to offer a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice acceptable to God; even ſo was Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17.

               <head>Some Arguments to prove the Opinion of the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> heretical and dangerous.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. That Doctrine or Opinion that ſaith Chriſt was not the Seed of the Woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. which was promiſed of God to break the Serpents head, is a dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. That Opinion that maketh the Tabernacle or Temple, Lamb, Prieſt, and Altar, ordained of God for Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (till Chriſt came in the fleſh) no true types of him, is a dangerous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But ſuch is their Opinion, Therefore dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. That Opinion which in it ſelf, or the natural conſequences depending thereon, maketh void all the promiſes of God concerning man's Salvation by Chriſt,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98571:53"/>muſt needs be a very dangerous Opinion: But ſuch is their Opinion; therefore dangerous.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons appear plain to every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial <hi>Reader</hi> in all theſe three Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>But here I will add, That either the Seed of the Woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. was God, which was juſtly offended with <hi>Adam</hi> for his ſin: Or elſe it was the Man Chriſt which was made of a Woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. But it was not God, that was made of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; therefore Man. And now for you to ſay that God the Creator of all things in Heaven and in Earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. made himſelf a Creature (or was made ſo) is falſe, as I ſaid before, and alſo impoſſible, ſith God is Perfection it ſelf. And to ſay that he paſſed through the Virgins womb as Water through a Conduit (as ſome He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks have ſaid) is alſo falſe. And to ſay he had an imaginary body, and not a real body (as ſome Hereticks have ſaid) is alſo very falſe, as appeareth by his death and reſurrection.</p>
               <p>As to the proof of the ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That the Lamb, the Prieſt, and the Altar were types of Chriſt; ſee what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid in the <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers,</hi> as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98571:53"/>alſo the Scriptures thereunto annexed. Which cannot be applyed to him, (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt) except you with us grant the two Natures to be in one Perſon. If you can, ſhew us how you do it.</p>
               <p>As to the proof of the third Argument, That your Opinion doth deny all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, I prove it thus. That O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that denyeth Chriſt to be the true Son of <hi>David,</hi> denyeth all the Promiſes of God concerning mans Salvation: But ſuch is your Opinion; Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. That Opinion that denieth the proper ſignification of the Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, &amp; the Lords Supper, muſt needs be a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Opinion: but ſuch is your Opinion, therefore dangerous. The reaſon of the <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition is, becauſe it denyeth the two Natures in Chriſt, which are lively ſet forth by the Sign and the thing ſignified by theſe Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For, as all the Ordinances of God's inſtituted Worſhip, as Sacrifices under the Law, &amp;c. ſo all the Sacraments under the Goſpel, ſeem to have immediate relation to Chriſt, as God manifeſted in the fleſh. For, you may obſerve they conſiſt of two parts, the one Natural, the other Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; the one External, the other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98571:54"/>the one as it were the Body, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Soul of it; the one repreſenting the Humanity, the other the Divinity of Chriſt: ſo that every Ordinance of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is (as it were) a repreſentation of Chriſt incarnate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Divine Eſſence or Godhead in Chriſt, ſeemeth to be the proper object of all Worſhip; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> and therefore will <hi>be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth in Chriſt bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. not locally, but by perſonal Union; and this is the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all Goſpel-worſhip, as I have ſaid before. And it was ſo in the time of the Law: for the Temple was God's dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.2. there was the only place of God's publick Worſhip, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 29.2. No Sacrifice might be offered in any other place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.26, 27. for there the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual worſhippers had by Faith a ſight of God, and communion with him by Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.2. &amp; 68.24. Towards the Temple they were to look whereſoever they were, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.29. Therefore what the Temple was to them under the Law, the ſame is Chriſt to us under the Goſpel; therefore, as the true worſhippers did not worſhip
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98571:54"/>the Temple (although the falſe did) but God that dwelleth in the Temple; even ſo, we may not worſhip the Temple (only) <hi>viz.</hi> the Humane Nature of Chriſt, but God in it; for it is the Spirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53, 54. And as there was in that Temple a Vail to go into the Holieſt of all, where God dwelt, between the Cherubims; even ſo it is now, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. We paſs through the vail, <hi>viz.</hi> the fleſh of Chriſt, into the Holieſt, if we are led there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to worſhip that Godhead that dwelleth in it. This is a right conception and true worſhip of God. For the Humanity of Chriſt was to the Godhead, as a back of mettle to a Cryſtal glaſs: for, look on ſuch a glaſs in its pure ſubſtance, and it is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent; put a back of mettle to it, and it gives a beautiful reflex: So if we take up conceptions of the Godhead in its pure Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, it is tranſparent; if we conſider of God as he is Infinite, Almighty, Immenſe, Eternal; what is this to the Creature or our comfort? If we conſider him in his Power, Juſtice, Wiſdom, Holineſs, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Truth, what is this to us? yea, all theſe are againſt us as we are ſinners: But if we take up a conception of God in all his Attributes, as they appear to us in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98571:55"/>Chriſt, ſo they make a moſt comfortable reflex upon us. In this Glaſs we behold the Glory of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame ſimilitude, from glory to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. In this Glaſs we behold that Wiſdom by which we are inſtructed, that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by which we are juſtified, that Power by which we are preſerved, that Grace by which we are choſen and called, that Goodneſs by which we are relieved and ſupplyed, that Holineſs by which we are transformed, that Glory to the which we ſhall be conformed: by all which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that our right apprehenſion and due conception of God muſt ſpring from the manifeſtation of God in Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>For no man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him, Matth.</hi> 11.27. For the Saints in the Law meditated devoutly upon his coming in the fleſh, many Prophets and righteous Men, ſaith Chriſt, deſired to ſee the things which you ſee, and have not ſeen them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.24. and what were theſe things? Surely it is God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh, as appeareth by St. <hi>Luke, Luk.</hi> 10.24.</p>
               <p>Now as <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Prieſt was
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98571:55"/>choſen from amongſt his brethren (and not of a ſtranger) <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.1. even ſo Chriſt the Antitype of <hi>Aaron,</hi> was taken out of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> which were his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren according to the fleſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>For it is evident that our Lord ſprang out of Judah,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.14. And this is that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you from amongst his brethren like unto me, him ſhall you hear in all things,</hi> Deut. 18.18. <hi>whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you,</hi> Acts 3.23. But notwithſtanding all this, the <hi>Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> deny that he was fleſh of our fleſh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Holy Ghoſt ſaith it again and again, both by the holy Prophets in the old Teſtament, and the holy Apoſtles in the New; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones, Eph.</hi> 5.30.</p>
               <p>Now ſith he was fleſh, as the <hi>Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> confeſs, and yet deny him to be our fleſh, againſt all theſe faithful Witneſſes as aforeſaid. I now deſire them to tell me (if they can) what fleſh it was, ſith St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew but four kinds of created fleſh, <hi>viz.</hi> one kind of fleſh of Men, another of Beaſts, another of Fiſh, and another of Birds, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.39. Now which of theſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98571:56"/>will you chuſe? If neither of theſe, I pray aſſign of what matter the fleſh of Chriſt was made; for we, with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> know no other than theſe four kinds of fleſh.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Chriſt is figured out by <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec</hi> and his Prieſthood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. for as he was a Prieſt and King, even ſo was Chriſt alſo; and as he was without Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Mother; even ſo was Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> without Father, in reſpect of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; and without Mother, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>Now there is no knowing of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but in, by, and through Chriſt (as I ſaid before): for in the works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God is above us; in his works of Providence, a God without us; in the Law, a God againſt us; in Himſelf; a God inviſible to us; only in Chriſt he is <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manual,</hi> God manifeſted in our fleſh, God in us, God with us, and God for us; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Chriſt God is apprehended aright, and there alſo worſhipped aright. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Whoſoever denieth the Son, hath not the Father: but he that acknowledgeth the Son, hath the Father alſo; Who is a lyar but he that denieth that Jeſus is the hriſt; he is Antichriſt that denieth the Father and the Son,</hi> verſ, 22.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:98571:56"/>
               <p>Now as the <hi>Eutichians</hi> err in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about Chriſt our Mediator, even ſo they do about the Holy Trinity alſo; for they do not rightly underſtand nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Unity and Trinity ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. Now if they be three, they be three Operations, or three Manifeſtations, or three Subſiſtances: but they be not the two former, therefore the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> three Subſiſtances: for St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Word was with God, and was God,</hi> Joh. 1.1. Now where there is one, and another with him, there muſt needs be a diſtinction; but St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith it is ſo; therefore.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, Where there is one ſending, and another ſent, there is a diſtinction: But the Father ſendeth, and the Son was ſent; therefore a diſtinction, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17.34. for, God ſent his Son into the World, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Again; the Father and the Son ſend the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. 'tis another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter; therefore a diſtinct Perſon both from the Father and the Son. Now if theſe have all of them, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Father, Son, and Spirit) Underſtanding and Will, then they are Perſons and not Qualities, for no Qualities can have Underſtanding, and Will, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. from <hi>ver.</hi> 3. to. 12.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:98571:57"/>
               <p>If the Father, Son, and Spirit, be all Creators of Heaven and Earth; then are they God by Nature; but they are all Creators of Heaven and Earth, therefore God by Nature, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, If they all know the thoughts, and ſearch the heart of man; then are they God by Nature: but they all do ſo; therefore.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, If they may all be ultimately ſinned againſt; then are they God by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but they may be ſo; therefore.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, If we may worſhip them with Divine Worſhip; then are they God by Nature; but we may worſhip them with Divine Worſhip; therefore.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly, If we may be baptized in their Name; then are they God by Nature: but we may, yea ought to be baptized in their Name; therefore God by Nature, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.19, 20.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is plain, becauſe we expect the remiſſion of our ſins in his Name, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we were baptized, as alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth; for God is a Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be worſhipped in Spirit, and in Truth.</p>
               <p>Now albeit St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, ſpeaking of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98571:57"/>Chriſt, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> Joh. 10.30.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98571:58"/>Perſons be one, as well as their Eſſence is one, which is indiviſible: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.6. <hi>I am, and there is none beſides me.</hi> Then the Father was he which took our Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. the Father was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Devil, he ſuffered hunger and thirſt, he was buffeted and and ſcourged of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and put to death by wicked hands; he alſo came down in the likeneſs of a Dove, and alſo of fiery Tongues; he begat himſelf; he is greater than himſelf; he ſent himſelf into the World; he gave himſelf a Seat at his own right hand; he is the expreſs Image of himſelf; he is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than himſelf.

Now if the Godhead was turned into fleſh, as Water was turned into Wine (as you ſay it was); and there can be but one God by Nature, both you and we ſay (and I hope believe); then, if the Father be that one God; [For, <hi>to us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6.] Then I pray conſider of your Opinion, as alſo the bad conſequences that depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. For, if you ſhall ſtill be obſtinate, and deny that the Eternal Word did ever take any fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> into Perſonal Union with it ſelf (as we ſay it did), but will ſtill ſay and believe that the Eternal Word, <hi>viz.</hi> God the Creator of Heaven and Earth, did make himſelf a Creature, <hi>viz.</hi> Man, and ſo died for our ſins; Then how you can acquit your ſelves from being rightly called blaſphemers of the Eternal God, which is only Immortal, and Immutable, (as I ſaid before) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet tell becauſe of the reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now foraſmuch as I underſtand, by ſome late Conferences I have had with our
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98571:59"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh Eutychians,</hi> that they deny (or at leaſt doubt of) God's Omnipreſence; and, with the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> think of God as if he were ſome old Man ſitting in ſome one place on a Throne, as Kings uſe to do; and ſo, with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and, <hi>Socinians,</hi> think that one may ſee, from his right hand to his left, as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith in his Anſwer to Mr. <hi>John Biddles</hi> Catechiſm. Now you may ſee by this, how one Error beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth another. For firſt they deny the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence of the Eternal God to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, Immenſe; and as the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſaith, <hi>To fill Heaven and Earth,</hi> Jer. 23.24. And as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him, how much leſs this Houſe which I have built,</hi> 2 Chron. 6.18. But they not minding ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as theſe (or elſe not underſtanding of them) but reading ſome other Scriptures, which ſpeak of his coming down from Heaven to ſee <hi>Sodom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18, 19 <hi>chap.</hi> As alſo becauſe man was made in his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and that he hath hands and feet, &amp;c. Therefore they cannot tell how he ſhould properly be a Spirit or Spiritual ſubſtance, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand the bleſſed Trinity, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:98571:59"/>
               <p>And indeed, without this be granted, the Trinity cannot be proved to be three Perſons, and yet but one God, as we ſay and believe, as aforeſaid: for although we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Perſons in the Godhead, yet we do not ſeparate them: becauſe the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is Infinite, and Omnipreſent. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>Whither ſhall I fly from thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? If I aſcend up into Heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in Hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou art there,</hi> Amos 9.2, 3, 4. And to give you one inſtance what we mean when we ſay they are diſtinct, and not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Eſſence of God, we mean after this manner: as when we-ſay there are three Faculties in the Soul of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> Underſtanding, Will, and Memory; now theſe three Faculties are diſtinct, yet not ſeparated from the Soul, for the Soul acts wholly in theſe three, yet not three Souls, but one Soul: even ſo is the Eternal Godhead in the Father, Son, and Spirit, and yet but one God: but this of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity is ſuch a great Myſtery, that no earthly ſimilitude will ſet it out plainly to our capacities. But I pray conſider the Viſion of the three Men that appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18. and the two that went to <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 19. And there you may ſee,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98571:60"/>although they be three Perſons, yet but one Lord, and ſo called and worſhipped of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 18. and of the two that went to <hi>Lot,</hi> after that they had told him their Meſſage, then he never called them Lords, but Lord; ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.18. Which two were the Son, and Holy Ghoſt, which were ſent by the Father, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.21, 22. for the Father is ſaid to ſend the Son, and Spirit, but he is never ſent of them. And thus you may ſee how <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Chriſt and was glad, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. compared with <hi>John</hi> 8.56, 58, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How is God ſaid to be preſent in all places at once?</hi> Pſal. 95.2, 6. &amp; 139.7. <hi>And alſo to fill Heaven and Earth?</hi> Jer. 23.24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a four-fold Preſence of God mentioned in the Scriptures; the firſt is his Preſence with all his Creatures, (which we may call his general Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) whereby he preſerveth all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſubſtances, and giveth unto them to live, move, and have a being; and this extendeth it ſelf to all his Creatures, both good and bad, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.28. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree is the Preſence of Grace, whereby he doth not only preſerve the ſubſtance of all his Creatures, but alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98571:60"/>grace onto them; this is to the Church of God on Earth. The third degree is the Preſence of Glory peculiar to the Saints and Angels in Heaven, where they ſhall ſee God face to face. The fourth degree is the Preſence of the Godhead of the Son, with the Manhood of Chriſt; for, <hi>in him dwelleth the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, Col.</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p>Now for the better underſtanding of this Myſtery, we muſt know that the Scriptures are to be taken four wayes, (at leaſt ſome of them) <hi>viz.</hi> firſt Hiſtorically; ſecondly, Analogically; thirdly, Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; and fourthly, Morally. As to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one of them for brevity ſake. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.9. <hi>And Moſes made a Serpent, and put it upon a Pole,</hi> &amp;c. It hath theſe four ſignifications, the firſt is Hiſtorical, it was a Serpent made; 2dly, Analogical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was lifted up; ſo muſt Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15. 3dly, Allegorically, that is another thing was meant by it, as appeareth by <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s taking of it away, and calling of it <hi>Nehuſhtan,</hi> that is, a piece of Braſs, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.4. 4thly, Morally, for they were to look upon it for their cure: Even ſo muſt we look upon Chriſt by Faith, as ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Look upon me
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98571:61"/>and be ye ſaved all the ends of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that he is preſent with all his Creatures to preſerve their ſubſtances, as I ſaid before, appeareth from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Who hath meaſured the Waters in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his hand, and meted out Heaven with the ſpan, and comprehended the duſt of the Earth in a meaſure, and weighed the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in ſcales, &amp; the Hills in a ballance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Nations are as the drop of a bucket, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance; behold, he taketh up the Iſles as a very little thing,</hi> verſ. 15. By which phraſes is meant, that he governeth and diſpoſeth of them at his pleaſure: for neither the Sun could give his light to us, nor the Fire heat; all theſe will periſh if he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Preſence but a moment from them; as alſo the Beaſts of the Field, for if he take away their breath, they die, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.28, 29. Even as the body of a Man when the Soul is gone, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>The body without the Spirit is dead:</hi> For, as St. <hi>Paul, In him we live and move, and have our being,</hi> (Acts 17.28.) <hi>As alſo certain of your own Poets have ſaid, For we are all his off-ſpring,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But ſin maketh a ſeparation betwixt us and God; for what communion hath light
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98571:61"/>with darkneſs, and Chriſt with Belial? Therefore he is not preſent with them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is not to be underſtood in the firſt degree, <hi>viz.</hi> to preſerve their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. but is meant in the ſecond degree, <hi>viz.</hi> his Grace with his Church on the Earth. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23. <hi>If any man love me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he will keep my words, and my Father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him:</hi> which is meant of his Grace, and Love; and his dwelling with them is by his Holy Spirit, as appeareth by his anſwer to <hi>Judas,</hi> which asked, How is it that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf unto us, and not unto the World? he had told him before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. &amp; 17. <hi>If you love me, keep my Commandments, and I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him; for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you. I will not leave you comfortleſs, I will come unto you.</hi> Thus you ſee how ſin ſeparateth us from God's Favour, Grace, and Spirit, but not from his Preſence: as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit?</hi> Or, <hi>Whither ſhall I flye from thy
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98571:62"/>Preſence? If I aſcend up into Heaven, thou art there: If I make my bed in Hell, thou art there: If I take the wings of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and dwell in the uttermoſt parts of the Sea, even there ſhall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand hold me.</hi> And as <hi>Amos</hi> ſaith, ſpeaking of ſinners, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.2. <hi>Though they dig into Hell, thence ſhall my hand take them; though they climb up to Heaven, thence will I bring them down; and though they hide themſelves in the top of Carmel, I will ſearch and take them out thence,</hi> &amp;c. For we muſt not imagine him to be contained in any one place, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> For, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Heaven, and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee, how much leſs this Houſe which I have built?</hi> 1 King. 8.27. And St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaith, <hi>He dwelleth not in Tabernacles made with hands,</hi> Acts 7. and <hi>yet he dwelt,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, betwixt the Cherubims.</hi> And the Lord ſaith of <hi>Zion, This is my reſt for ever, here will I dwell:</hi> therefore ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord out of Zion that dwelleth at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> Pſal. 135.21. Now this muſt be meant of his Grace, or gracious Preſence there, and not his perſonal Preſence; for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98571:62"/>if ſo, then he was not in Heaven at that time (which I think no wiſe man will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve); therefore when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord:</hi> he means the beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Viſion, or face of God in glory, which cannot be ſeen with theſe mortal eyes; therefore he ſaith, <hi>When we are abſent from the body, we are preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 8. he meaneth in the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>viz.</hi> the glorious Preſence of God in Heaven with the Church Triumphant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>If God be a Spirit,</hi> Joh. 14.24. <hi>how then doth the Scriptures aſcribe to him hands, and feet, and almoſt all the parts of a man, ſith Chriſt ſaith, A Spirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is to be underſtood Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, as alſo by way of Analogy. For, like as men uſe to hold water in the hollow of their hand, and alſo ſpan with it; even ſo, the Lord, albeit he is a Spirit, or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſubſtance, yet to help our infirmity ſpeaketh to us, as it were, in our own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ſaith he meaſureth Heaven with a ſpan, and holdeth the water in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his hand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.12. And as men ſee with their eyes, and hear with their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98571:63"/>eares; even ſo the Lord is ſaid to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.15. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous, and his ears are open unto their Prayers. The hand of the Lord hath driven out the Heathen.</hi> Now a Spirit hath not hands, eyes, and ears, &amp;c. Therefore when the Scriptures attribute theſe to God, <hi>viz.</hi> hands, eyes, lips, tongue, noſe, heart, head, face, and back-parts, &amp;c. it is not to be underſtood litterally, but in the ſecond or third ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Analogically, or Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, that is, another thing is meant; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. As for Example: his right hand ſignifieth his Power: for <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The right hand of the Lord doth valiantly; the right hand of the Lord is exalted,</hi> Pſal. 118.15, 16. And his finger is compared to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.20. <hi>But if I with the finger of God caſt out Devils, no doubt the Kingdom of God is come unto you:</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.28. <hi>But if caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is come unto you.</hi> And thus I might ſhew how the reſt might be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but for brevity ſake I forbear.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. <hi>How is God ſaid to repent,</hi> Gen. 6.6. <hi>ſith other Scriptures ſay, he is not as Man that he ſhould repent, or as the Son of Man that he ſhould change his mind? For the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98571:63"/>gifts and callings of God are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Rom. 11.29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Albeit God is ſaid ſometimes to be angry with us, and ſometimes pleaſed, this doth not prove any change in God, but when we break his Commandments and ſet light by his Promiſes, and follow our corrupt wayes, we are changed, and not he; We be mutable, he is immutable; for <hi>in him there is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1.17. He is ſaid to be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied &amp; pleaſed, when we turn from our evil ways, &amp; ſo turn to him by true repentance. See for this <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.9. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.18. For when God is ſaid to laugh at mens calamities, and mock when their fear co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. We are not by theſe and ſuch-like ſayings, to think that God hath ſuch Affections, and Paſſions as be in Man; for God hateth ſuch as mock at his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and deſpiſeth his Word; yea, God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horeth the ſcornful man: but as thoſe men that laugh at our calamities, are the furtheſt off from helping of us out of it; even ſo is God when he laugheth at our calamity. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28. So he is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.23. to ſleep, <hi>Ariſe, wherefore doſt thou ſleep, O Lord? Ariſe for our help, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us, for thy mercy ſake,</hi> verſ. 26. Now
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98571:64"/>the Lord keepeth his Vineyard leſt any hurt it, <hi>I will keep it night and day,</hi> Iſa. 27.3. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>He neither ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth,</hi> Pſal. 121.4. But this is to be underſtood Metaphorically, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; as when he is ſaid to <hi>awake,</hi> it is meant his ſpeedy coming to help us, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to ſleeping, which is his delaying to come to help us. And ſo when <hi>Moſes</hi> is deſirous to ſee his face, and to ſpeak with him face to face, it muſt be meant of ſome high degree of his manifeſtation of Grace, but not of Glory: for ſo no mortal man can ſee his face and live. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him,</hi> Joh. 1.18. for he is inviſible, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. who only hath immortality, dwelling in that light which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee: for he ſitteth upon the Circle of the Earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as graſhoppers. <hi>That ſtretcheth out the Heavens as a curtain, and ſpreadeth them out as a Tent to dwell in. That bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Princes to nothing, he maketh the Judges of the Earth as vanity. To whom then will you liken me, or ſhall I be equal, ſaith the Holy One?</hi> Iſa. 40.22. to the 26.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98571:64"/>For, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>By theſe things we ſpeak the Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery, even the hidden Wiſdom which God ordained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World unto our glory, which none of the Princes of this World knew;</hi> for, <hi>had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory; but God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit:</hi> for, <hi>the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. Now we have not received the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit that is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God; which things alſo we ſpeak, not in the words that man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual: But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now I have, according to my meaſure, given you my underſtanding of theſe great Myſteries of God, and the Father, and of Chriſt, and of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. in as ſhort and plain a method as I could, for your information, &amp;c. Now of that which hath been ſpoken as concerning God, by me in this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> this is the ſumme; That God is a Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.4.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98571:65"/>or ſpiritual ſubſtance, or pure nature, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, inviſible, unſearchable, filling Heaven and Earth. Full of underſtanding, of truth and righteouſneſs, of mercy and wiſdom, and all manner of goodneſs; without beginning, and without ending, not created nor made, and Maker of all things, ſubject to nothing, and governing all things, knowing all things, yea, even the inward thoughts and intents of the hearts of men; forgiving ſins; only to be honoured and called upon, only hearing our prayers, juſtifying, and ſaving us; of an almighty arm, and majeſty; the Father unbegotten, the Son begotten, the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from them both, as I have proved by the Word of God, which cannot lye. Now all theſe things (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) be rightly applyed to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; ſo that it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that to whomſoever theſe things may rightly be applyed, he is God by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not by Name only, as they are, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods, but ye ſhall die like men,</hi> &amp;c. But unto God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are theſe things only properly and truly applyed: therefore they <hi>only</hi> are God by Nature. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>There be three that bear record
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98571:65"/>in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and theſe three are one. And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us underſtanding that we might know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt; this is the true God and Eternal Life. Little Children, keep your ſelves from Idols,</hi> verſ. 20, 21. <hi>Now the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all, Amen.</hi> 2 Cor. 13.14, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>NOw becauſe I would, if poſſibly I could, remove all doubtings about the Holy Trinity, concerning their being three Perſons, and one God; I will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add to what I have ſaid, ſome Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove that they are all three God by Nature: that ſo I might ſatisfie ſome, who muſt and will have their reaſon ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98571:66"/>or elſe they will not believe it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Opinions that I oppoſe in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> (as aforeſaid), ſeems to grant the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be God by Nature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take it <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> and reaſon with them by an <hi>Argumentum ad hominum.</hi> And, firſt, for the better underſtanding of the honeſt and ſimple-hearted, which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture may conſcionably doubt whether the Son, and Holy Ghoſt, be God equal with the Father; becauſe of the late op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that is made againſt it by the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of the aforeſaid Opinions. I ſay, I will go in this plain method, and make a compariſon betwixt the Father and the Son, <hi>viz.</hi> as he is the Eternal Word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. in ſeveral things that I find in Scripture concerning them: and then I will apply theſe to the Holy Ghoſt alſo, as you may ſee if you will, for I hope you are not obſtinate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt Propoſition.</hi> The Father is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by Nature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. therefore God. Parallel to this the Son is a Spirit by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore God. Proof from God's Word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17.</p>

            <p>Now of that which hath been ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt's Divine Nature, this is the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98571:68"/>ſum. For I have endeavoured in this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> to ſhew you in <hi>twenty Particulars,</hi> that Chriſt is God by Nature. And here I will repeat them all for your memory-ſake. The firſt is his Eternity. 2. His Simplicity. 3. His Immutability. 4. His Inviſibility. 5. His Immenſity. 6. His Infiniteneſs. 7. His Omnipotency. 8. His Wiſdom. 9. His Goodneſs. 10. His Love. 11. His Grace. 12. His Mercy. 13. His Long-ſuffering. 14. His Holineſs. 15. His Juſtice. 16. His Faithfulneſs. 17. His Truth. 18. His Omniſciency. 19. His Omnipreſence. 20. His Providence over all his Creatures. All theſe twenty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and Attributes, belong to God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But all theſe belong to Chriſt as he is <hi>Davids</hi> Lord; therefore Chriſt, as he is <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, is God by Nature, who is God over all bleſſed for ever, Amen. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And now I will briefly ſhew you how he is <hi>Davids</hi> Son according to the fleſh (as I have ſaid before.) Firſt, He had the ſubſtance of a true Body, and reaſonable Soul. 2. The Properties of Body and Soul; in the body, length, breadth, and thickneſs, and circumſcription. And in the Soul, the faculties of underſtanding both
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98571:69"/>ſimple, and compound, as Will, Affection, Love, Hatred, Deſire, Joy, Fear, &amp;c. The Powers alſo of Hearing, Feeling, Seeing, Smelling, Taſting; Moving, Grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Eating, Sleeping, &amp;c. 3dly, He took unto himſelf the blameleſs infirmities of mans Nature, which are certain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural defects in man, as Paſſions of Body and Mind, as to be Hungry, Thirſty, Weary, Sad, Sorrowful, and Ignorant of ſome things, and Angry; alſo, to increaſe in Stature, Wiſdom, Knowledge, &amp;c. So that as the holy Ghoſt ſaith, We ſee by theſe things, that <hi>he was made like unto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in all things;</hi> yea &amp; in <hi>all points temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like as we are, yet without ſin,</hi> Heb. 2.17. &amp; 4.15.</p>
            <p>Now ſith the Scriptures do affirm all theſe things to belong properly and truly to Chriſt, as he is <hi>Davids</hi> Son and Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, then muſt he needs be Man by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For unto no Creature neither in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nor in Earth, doth the Holy Ghoſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all theſe things properly and literally, but to man only, &amp;c. If he do, ſhew me an inſtance, for as yet I know none: and therefore why you ſhould ſo much as once doubt whether he took our Nature, (<hi>viz.</hi> the fleſh of <hi>Mary</hi>) ſith the Scripture
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98571:69"/>affirms it ſo plainly again, and again, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine. But when I do not only hear you ſay you doubt, but confidently deny that ever he took any fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> This makes me to ſtand and admire, and with St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, Who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſo many plain and evident proofs; can any Article of the Chriſtian Faith be more plainly proved than this is? ſurely no.</p>
            <p>Now if I did not think that the Devil had bewitched many, and that Pride, falſe Opinions, and Self-love had blinded mens underſtandings,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> about the Family of Love, <hi>pag. 803.</hi>
               </note> I could not believe any judicious man that believes the Scriptures to be true, if he will but now ſit down in humility, and ſeriouſly conſider what hath here been ſaid from them, to prove that Chriſt is God by Nature, and alſo Man by Nature, can ſtill remain doubting and unbelieving. But if he be one that was once inlightned into this Truth, and alſo profeſſed it with us, and was baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Faith, and yet did not receive it in the love of it; and after all this advice, which now and at other times, hath been uſed, by my ſelf and others, to them; I ſay, if they ſhall ſtill oppoſe this Truth, then what can I think; but that if they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98571:70"/>do not ſpeedily repent of this their dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Opinion, of denying the Lord that bought them, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. then that which is written in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.11. will come upon them. But that it may never be ſo, is and ſhall be the Prayer of your very good friend, which loves your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons but not your Principles, (though haply not ſo eſteemed of you) that God would give you Repentance to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Truth, that you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover your ſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, who hath taken ſome of you cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at his will.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay he took upon him the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of fleſh, ſimply as it is fleſh, but of the fleſh of ſin, or ſinful fleſh: for he had ſaid before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.3. That he was made of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh. And alſo again in <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Whoſe are the Fathers, and of whom, as concerning the fleſh, Chriſt came, &amp;c.</hi> And I pray you tell me what St, <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth by theſe words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>For I could wiſh that my ſelf were accurſed from Chriſt, for my Brethren my Kinſmen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh?</hi> And then you may tell your ſelves what he means by theſe words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Whoſe are the Fathers, and of whom as concerning the fleſh Chriſt came:</hi> The word <hi>fleſh</hi> being the ſame in the 3d and 5th verſe, and of the ſame ſignification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. From <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. But the <hi>Eutychians</hi> ſay, <hi>That the Divine Nature of Chriſt was turned into fleſh, and ſo was made like to his brethren in all things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting two,</hi> viz. <hi>ſin, and earthy matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Holy Ghoſt doth except but <hi>one</hi> thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin, (if it be proper to call ſin a thing) <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. &amp; 4.15. And how dare you ſay <hi>two?</hi> Have you no fear of the curſe of God coming upon you, ſith
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98571:71"/>he ſaith, Curſed is he that addeth, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth? See <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Add thou not unto his words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a lyar,</hi> Prov. 30.6.</p>
            <p>Bur, Secondly, I anſwer to that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. (it having the moſt ſhew of any of the Texts that I know for your Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) therefore I will endeavour by God's help, to ſhew you that it was never writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to that end, to juſtifie your Opinion; and therefore I pray conſider what St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>The Word which was in the beginning was with God, and was God; by whom all things were made, and without whom was nothing made that was made. In whom was Life, and the Life was the light of men, for he lighteth every man that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the World: by whom the World was made;</hi> Was in the fulneſs of time made a Man in a Humane Body, having his Divine Majeſty dwelling in him, full of Grace and Truth; ſo that we beheld his Glory, ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> in his Miracles, in his Grace, and Truth, in his Holy and wiſe Doctrine, ſuch as manifeſted him to be the only begotten of the Father, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 16. which <hi>is in the boſom of the Father;</hi> mark that word, <hi>is in</hi> the boſom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he doth not ſay which <hi>[was]</hi> but <hi>[is],</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:98571:71"/>which muſt be underſtood of his Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the World was made, of the ſubſtance of his Father, for the term notes Generation, and ſubſiſtence from his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not Creation or making that which was the Creator into fleſh, that ſo he might be a Creature, and ſo die; this was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, ſith God cannot die, nor yet be changed, as I have oft ſaid and proved in this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. and many other places of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>John</hi> doth not ſay he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but made fleſh; for ſaith he, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh,</hi> even as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. <hi>made of the Seed of David;</hi> and <hi>came of the Fathers according to the fleſh,</hi> Chap. 9.5. and <hi>made of a Woman,</hi> Gal. 4.4. And ſo, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, He came out of the loins of <hi>David,</hi> according to the fleſh, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30. for ſo God had ſworn <hi>to David,</hi> Pſal. 132.11. For <hi>Solomon</hi> was but a Type, which came out of his loins, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.19. All theſe Texts do expreſly teach us that Chriſt had a Humane Nature, which is termed the fleſh; as it is frequent by the word <hi>fleſh</hi> to underſtand a man or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>No fleſh
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98571:72"/>can be juſtified in his ſight,</hi> which muſt be underſtood of men, alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give Eternal Life to as many as thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider this word, <hi>raiſed up according to the fleſh, out of the loins of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> which plainly ſheweth that there was another Nature, which was <hi>Davids</hi> Lord: <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.44. which was not raiſed up out of his loins, which was God over all bleſſed for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. Elſe why was it not ſaid of him without this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Thou ſhalt not build the Houſe, but thy Son that ſhall come forth out of thy loins. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.19. He doth not ſay, according to the fleſh, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this diſtinction made, concerning any man but only Chriſt; which was <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> God and Man in one Perſon, or, <hi>God with us,</hi> Matth. 1.23. From whence I infer, That He who is ſo <hi>David</hi>'s Son ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, raiſed out of the fruit of his loins according to the fleſh; made of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh, and of the Father's according to the fleſh; As that he alſo is <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, and the Son of God, God over all bleſſed for ever, is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98571:72"/>conſubſtantial with his Father as touching his Godhead, and conſubſtantial with us as touching his Manhood: but ſuch is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; therefore God by Nature, and Man alſo. And now, I hope, I have An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered your great Objection, and alſo told you how he is truly called the Son of God, as being in the boſom of his Father, and alſo how he is truly called the Son of Man, and ſo the Son of <hi>David,</hi> as being made of a Daughter of <hi>David,</hi> which <hi>Mary</hi> was. See for proof of this <hi>Luke</hi> the 3d <hi>Chap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now what hath been ſaid in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Objection, if heeded by you, will Anſwer all your Objections, from <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. from the 50 <hi>verſe</hi> to the 64. For <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>No man hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man, which is in Heaven:</hi> which proveth the union of Natures in one Perſon, otherwiſe he could not be in Heaven and Earth at one time.</p>
            <p>Now I hope you will not ſay with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> your Adverſaries, that after his Baptiſm he aſcended immediately up into Heaven, and there received his Commiſſion from his Father to preach the Goſpel, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did his in Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> concerning the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. And yet if Chriſt hath
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98571:73"/>but one Nature as you ſay, (with them he had not) then I pray tell me (if you can) Whether the Eternal Word was ever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Man, or the Son of Man, properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Ghoſt overſhadowed the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and ſo he was born of her, or made of her according to the fleſh; for it is the Perſon (<hi>viz.</hi> the Word) that is ſaid to come down from Heaven, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.62. <hi>What if ye ſhall</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſee the Son of Man</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's Humane Nature) <hi>aſcend up where he</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> his Divine Nature) <hi>was before?</hi> For as he is the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> he was not there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as appeareth by what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.46. <hi>The firſt Adam was made a living Soul, the laſt Adam was made a quickning Spirit. Howbeit that was not firſt which is ſpiritual; but that which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and afterward that which is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: The firſt Man is of the Earth, Earthy; the ſecond Man is the Lord from Heaven. As is the Earthy, ſuch are they alſo that are Earthy; and as is the Heavenly, ſuch are they which are Heavenly. And as we have born the Image of the Earthy, we ſhall alſo bear the Image of the Heavenly.</hi> So that by this compariſon, the natural Man was before the ſpiritual, which cannot be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98571:73"/>meant of the Eternal Word, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Lord, the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. For ſo conſidered as he is the Eternal Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. he was before <hi>Adam,</hi> or elſe he could not have Created him, and all other things which he did, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. So then, as the natural <hi>Adam</hi> was the firſt Man that God Created, ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Humane Nature of Chriſt) was the firſt Spiritual Man that was raiſed from the dead, and ſo aſcended up into Heaven, and was glorified, and ſo is the beginning of the Creation of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.14. And the firſt-born from the dead; for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was the first fruits of them that ſleep:</hi> and ſo becauſe of the Perſonal Union, is called <hi>the firſt and the laſt, even he that was dead and is alive, and behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I live for evermore, and have the keyes of Hell, and Death,</hi> Rev. 1.18. Now the Name Almighty which is applyed to Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8. muſt needs be meant as he was <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. And as St. <hi>John</hi> calleth him <hi>Davids</hi> Root. But when St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth him the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> it muſt be as he is his Son, or off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring; for the true <hi>Adam</hi> is never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in all the Scripture applied to God,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98571:74"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> the Divine Nature: for you know <hi>Adam</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Earth,</hi> viz. the Matter which Man was made of. And as for the term <hi>Heavenly,</hi> it is as truly applyed to the Saints, as to the Humane Nature of Chriſt; for <hi>verſ.</hi> 48. <hi>As is the Earthy, ſuch are they alſo that are Earthy; and as is the Heavenly, ſuch are they alſo that are Heavenly.</hi> Which St. <hi>Paul</hi> applyes to the Saints after their Reſurrection, <hi>verſ.</hi> 44. <hi>It is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body.</hi> So that <hi>Paul</hi> doth not run the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel betwixt the Natural body, and the Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> the Creator as aforeſaid: For if you obſerve him, he calleth the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Spiritual alſo, <hi>verſ.</hi> 46. and calleth the Saints Heavenly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 49. Now will you ſay, becauſe the bodies of the Saints after their Reſurrection are Spiritual bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, therefore their bodies are Spirits? Surely no. Even ſo, albeit the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> after his Reſurrection is called Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that therefore his body is a Spirit, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> think: even ſo, albeit the Saints bodies are called Heavenly, doth that prove that the original Matter they were made of, came from Heaven? You will ſurely ſay, No. Even ſo ſay I of the body of Chriſt. For the main deſign of the Apoſtle in all
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98571:74"/>this <hi>Chapter,</hi> was to prove the Reſurrection of the dead, as appears by <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>But if there be no Reſurrection of the Dead, then is not Chriſt riſen:</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>If Chriſt be not raiſed, your Faith is vain, you are yet in your ſins; then they alſo which are faln a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in Chriſt, are periſhed.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive,</hi> &amp;c. Now where there are divers Opinions, they may be all falſe, there can be but one true, and that one Truth oft-times muſt be fetched by piece-meal out of divers branches of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinions, &amp;c. For, although the Lord hath made all Nations of one blood, and commanded them to ſeek the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. yet if you divide them into thirty parts, ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of them be <hi>Heathens,</hi> and <hi>Pagans;</hi> then there remains but eleven, and of theſe, five be <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mahometans;</hi> then there remains but a ſixth-part of the thirty; and of theſe ſix, How few do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God aright! (God knows they be very few): as for the twenty four parts of the thirty, they do not own Chriſt to be their Saviour, no not ſo much as in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; as to the other ſix-parts, it is true, they all confeſs him to be the Son of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98571:75"/>God, and in ſome ſenſe their Saviour alſo: Yet ſo, as by ſome of their Opinions, they by juſt conſequence deny him, either in his Divine Nature, or in his Humane, or elſe in the Union of Natures, and ſo by conſequence deny the true Chriſt, and of them that do profeſs him to be both <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, and <hi>Davids</hi> Son alſo; yet of them how few do love him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.46. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I ſay?</hi> The Lord grant for his Sons ſake that I and you may be of thoſe Sheep that will hear the Voice of the true Shepherd, and ſo follow him; and will not follow a ſtranger, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. Where ſhall I begin to wonder at thee, O thou Divine and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Peace-maker, the Saviour of Men, the Anointed of God, the Mediator between God and Man, in whom there is nothing which doth not exceed, not only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, but the very wonder of Angels; who ſaw thee in thy Humiliation with ſilence, and Adore thee in thy Glory with perpetual Prayers and Rejoycings; Thou waſt for ever of thy ſelf as God, of the Father as the Son, the Eternal Son of an Eternal Father; not later in Beginning, not leſs in Dignity, not other in Subſtance,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98571:75"/>begotten without diminution of him that begat thee, while he communicated whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thee, which he retained wholly in himſelf, becauſe both were Infinite, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inequality of Nature, without divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Eſſence; when being in this eſtate, thine infinite Love and Mercy to deſperate Mankind, cauſed thee, O Saviour, to empty thy ſelf of thy Glory, that thou mighteſt put on our ſhame and miſery! Wherefore not ceaſing to be God as thou wert, thou beganſt to be what thou waſt not, <hi>viz.</hi> Man, to the end thou mighteſt be a perfect Mediator betwixt God and Man, which were both in one Perſon; God, that thou mighteſt ſatisfie; and Man, that thou mighteſt ſuffer; that ſince Man had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and God was offended, thou which wert God and Man, mightſt ſatisfie God for Man; None but thy ſelf which art the Eternal Word, can expreſs to us this great Myſtery, how God ſhould be manifeſted in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, Preached unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on in the World, and received up into Glory, and we in him, &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Containing the uſe of the whole Treatiſe.</head>
            <p>NOw, as aforeſaid, I will further add, to that that I have ſaid, ſomething by way of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> and <hi>Application,</hi> and ſo leave the whole to the bleſſing of God, and your ſerious Conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. Concerning the Incarnation of the Son of God,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> we muſt know that it is a great Myſtery, and therefore here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;</p>
            <p>Firſt, Who is Incarnate? The ſecond Perſon in Trinity: Firſt, for that God by him created Man, and therefore by him muſt we be recreated and redeemed: Secondly, for that he is the Eſſential Image of God, to reſtore the Image of God loſt in <hi>Adam.</hi> So this I believe the whole Godhead is not incarnate,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.14. Luk. 1.35.</note> nor any Perſon but the Son; the Perſon of the Son (I ſay) ſubſiſting in the Godhead.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This I muſt ſay and believe, that he was a perfect Man in every reſpect
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98571:76"/>like to <hi>Adam,</hi> ſin only excepted, ſubject to all unblameable and general infirmities which appertain to the whole Nature of Man, as Paſſions of Body and Mind.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This I muſt believe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch, that it was neceſſary that he ſhould become Man: firſt to ſatisfie God in that Nature we offend: Secondly, for that not one elſe could fulfil Righteouſneſs which the Law required of us, but he: Thirdly, for that our Redeemer muſt die for our ſins: Fourthly, He muſt be a Mediator, and make Requeſts, and ſpeak to God and Man for Reconciliation; Man before the Fall could ſpeak to God face to face, but now he cannot, nor may not come neer, but in the face and favour of Chriſt, whoſe face is to be found in the Goſpel.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Duties which follow this Faith,</head>
               <p>Firſt, Draw near to Chriſt and cleave unto him, for we ſee he is come near us, and become our <hi>Emmanuel.</hi> Iſa. 7. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Here is a Patern and Preſident for us of unſpeakable Humility,<note place="margin">Pſal. 22. Iſa. 53.</note> 
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7. There is a ſecret Pride in all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> till God change their hearts, and this Pride, the leſs we diſcern it, the more
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98571:77"/>it is; and the more we diſcern it, the leſs it is.</p>
               <p>This I obſerve touching this Incarnation of Chriſt, That his Conception by the work of the Holy Ghoſt was wonderful: for it was done in the Womb of the Virgin, that albeit he took of her very fleſh, which came of ſinful <hi>Adam,</hi> yet was the fleſh of Chriſt, I mean his Humane Nature, Body and Soul, without ſin. To prevent that original corruption which comes to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by natural Propagation, the great Wiſdom of God provided, That his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation ſhould be by the immediate work of the Holy Ghoſt, without any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Generation, or Means of Man on Earth, or Angels in Heaven or Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>I proceed on to ſpeak of the Birth of Chriſt: He was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of the Union of Natures Divine and Humane in this one Perſon. This I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve indeed, for ſo did the Patriarchs and Prophets of old, becauſe of the Divine Oracles which God gave them concerning the Incarnation of the Son of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.18. &amp; 12.3, 4. &amp; 21. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. and therefore much more ought we, ſeeing we have in the Goſpel the Complement of all
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98571:77"/>thoſe Propheſies, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.25. to believe in Jeſus Chriſt born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but alſo in time, and according to the courſe of Nature born of the ſaid Virgin, and brought forth into the World by her.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a Duty following this Faith is this; Thankſgiving for the Incarnation of the Son of God, as we ſee by the Examples of the Angels praiſing God for this benefit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.14. The Virgin praiſing God for this benefit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.46. And the holy Prieſt <hi>Zachary</hi> praiſing God for this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.68.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Conſolation following this Faith is Preached unto us by the Angels, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.10. when he ſaith, <hi>Behold, I bring you tydings of great joy that ſhall be to all People:</hi> Hence comes, Firſt, Peace with God: Secondly, Peace with our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: Thirdly, with the Holy Angels: Fourthly, with all the Creatures of God in the frame of Heaven and Earth. The proper Name of Chriſt's Mother was <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> this is teſtified often in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.5, &amp;c. This Name is added for a more certain and ſpecial deſcription of his Mother, that my Faith may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certified of the truth of all Divine Oracles and Propheſies concerning him:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98571:78"/>for this holy Woman being (as <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifie) of the noble Race of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> it is clear that our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt came of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Promiſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. &amp; 49. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Again, ſhe is called <hi>A Virgin,</hi> both to let us ſee the accompliſhment of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14, 21. and to aſſure us of that as aforeſaid, that is, That he is the only begotten Son of God, conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and not by the ordinary courſe of Nature.</p>
               <p>And this bleſſed Mother of Chriſt a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Propheteſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.48. We do willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour her three wayes, Firſt, by thankſgiving to God for her: Secondly, by a reverent eſtimation of her: Thirdly, by imitation of her excellent Vertues.</p>
               <p>And thus having ſeen by clear evidence from the Word of the Lord, that our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, as touching his Natures, is very God and very Man: it reſteth only that we learn alſo by Divine demonſtration, that theſe two Natures are united in one Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Firſt, here then we muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed that there be two kinds of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Union in Nature, and Union in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98571:78"/>Perſon. Union in Nature is when two or more things are joyned or united into one Nature, as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, being and remaining three diſtinct Perſons, are one and the ſame in Nature, or Godhead. Union in Perſon is when two things are in that manner uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they make but one Perſon or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: as the Body and Soul of Man meeting together make one Man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Union of Natures then here is this; The ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, or the Son of God doth aſſume to it a Manhood in ſuch order that the ſame being void of all Perſonal being in it ſelf, doth wholly and only ſubſiſt in the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, or depends wholly on the Perſon of the Son: So that now it is a Nature only, and not a Perſon; becauſe it doth not ſubſiſt alone as in other men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This then I underſtand and believe here, that the everlaſting Son of God, without any putting off of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, without any commixtion or converſion, was made that which before his Incarnation he was not, to wit, very Man. By taking fleſh by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt from the Virgin, and an
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98571:79"/>Humane Soul created of nothing, both which Natures being united together in a moſt admirable Perſonal union, make one moſt bleſſed Perſon, even the moſt ſacred Perſon of our only Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath in his Humanity ſo aſſumed all the Properties of Man's Nature, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in all things like unto us (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17.) ſin only excepted: for he hath ſo Perſonally united unto himſelf our Nature, that we cannot ſay properly of his Paſſion, that only the bare Humanity ſuffered (which yet is only paſſible) but this we are to ſay, that the Perſon which is very God hath ſuffered in our Nature.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, We muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Lord Chriſt aſſumed our Nature (as he did ſometimes under the Law, before his Incarnation, take to him the form of Man and Angel for a time) but retains ſtill and for ever, the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul of Man, howbeit now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: For the Apoſtle ſaith, Our Mediator hot only <hi>[was]</hi> but alſo <hi>[is]</hi> the Man Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. living for ever to make interceſſion for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:98571:79"/>
               <p>Conſolations following this Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt's pure Conception, Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this unſpeakable union of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in this one ſacred Perſon, are theſe;</p>
               <p>Firſt, I underſtand and conceive he is a moſt fit Advocate to his Father being very God, and a moſt comfortable Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for me, being very Man, well-acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all my grievances, and one I may boldly draw near unto, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16, 17, 18. &amp; 4.16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I conceive alſo that he hath been ſo acquainted in our fleſh, with our temptations, that he hath a ſpecial experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our infirmities in his own ſacred Perſon: not that the Son of God hath need of our Afflictions and Temptations to make him Merciful unto us, but for that we can beſt perſwade our ſelves of his Mercy, when we learn that he hath been acquainted with our Paſſions.</p>
               <p>And now I will tell you briefly, what I mean by the Properties of the Humane and Divine Nature: And by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication or Conjunction of Properties, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>When I ſay and believe, that Chriſt did aſſume all the Eſſential Properties of Man's Nature, I mean he took not only the Soul
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98571:80"/>and Body of Man, but alſo every quality and adjunct thereunto appertaining (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſin) for he had the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Reaſon, the Will, and all the Affections of Man (without ſin) being made like his brethren in all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17.</p>
               <p>Again, when I believe and ſay, That Chriſt did retain in his Perſonal Union of both Natures, all the Properties of his Divine Nature, I mean theſe and the like, that he was, this very Perſon now God and Man, Eternal, Almighty, Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, Immutable, moſt Perfect; for theſe and the like be the Properties of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Communication of theſe Properties (as the learned ſpeak, for the better underſtanding of ſome Scriptures uttered concerning this ſacred Perſon) is this, when we aſcribe that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto one Nature. unto the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the aforeſaid Perſonal Union of both Natures: as when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God hath purchaſed the Church with his own blood.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 20.28.</note> This manner of ſpeaking is with reſpect to this Union, and herein that which is proper to the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is aſcribed unto the Divine: for that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98571:80"/>this ſacred Perſon which did this great Work with his own blood is very God. But here we be alſo to obſerve, that there is no Communication of the Eſſential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of theſe Natures; but in the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete</hi> only (as Logicians ſpeak) not in the <hi>abſtract;</hi> as we may ſay truly, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctrine of Godlineſs, that God died for us; but we may not ſay therefore, the Deity died for us.</p>
               <p>And here beloved, I will ſhew you once more, why our Mediator muſt be very God and very Man, and that theſe two Natures muſt thus admirably be united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and his Conception ſo pure.</p>
               <p>Firſt, briefly for the firſt; <hi>He muſt be very God.</hi> Firſt, becauſe he hath received a Charge from his Father (which did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an infinite Power) to wit, by his Merits and Vertue to ſave the Elect or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, for it was needful that his Price ſhould over-prize our ſins. Secondly, If he had not been very God, he could not have overcome death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3, 4. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that it behoved him alſo to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and kill ſin and death in us, even in our Conſciences. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24, 25. and to quicken us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. by giving us the Spirit of Faith to apprehend all his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98571:81"/>and to apply the ſame unto our ſelves. Now who can give the Holy Ghoſt but God himſelf? <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.7, 8. Laſtly, He was to looſen and deſtroy all the accurſed works of Satan in us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And for the ſecond Point, <hi>He muſt be very Man.</hi> Firſt, that God might declare his unchangeable Juſtice, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin, and his unſpeakable Love and Mercy to the Elect: the firſt he ſheweth in puniſhing ſin in his own Son: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he declareth in that he puniſheth not our ſins in out ſelves, but in another. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That we might conceive rightly of the Brotherly Affection of our Mediator towards us: and how that he which ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth, and they that are ſanctified, are all of one. Thirdly, For that God had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it with an Oath, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould come of the loins of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 133. &amp; 89. and of the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man according to the Goſpel preached in the beginning in Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For the third Point, <hi>This I believe and avouch briefly, That Salvation could not have been obtained for Man, unleſs the Nature of God and Man were united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Perſon.</hi> Firſt, Becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this work had not been performed by
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98571:81"/>blood of the Son of God, and ſo it had been inſufficient for us. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Humanity of Chriſt could never have born that puniſhment for ſin. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Salvation thus obtained could never have been maintained, but that theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be thus knit together: for that Chriſt is and muſt be the pledge of our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.44. Fourthly, By this means we have as it were kindred with God in Jeſus Chriſt, who is become our <hi>Emmanuel, God with us,</hi> or God manifeſt in our fleſh. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For the fourth and laſt branch of the Queſtion; <hi>I ſay, and believe, that it was neceſſary our Lord and Saviour ſhould be pure, without the ſtain of ſin in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and that the Holy Ghoſt in this great Work did ſo provide.</hi> Firſt, For that the moſt glorious and Divine Nature of God could never elſe be united unto the Humane. Secondly, For that a ſinner could never have been accepted to make this Atonement, or to offer up any Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſin. Thirdly, For that he could not have Sanctified others, unleſs he were the moſt Pure, and the moſt Holy One of God in himſelf. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. &amp; 10.9, 10.</p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:98571:82"/>
               <p>Thus then the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, our moſt bleſſed Saviour and Redeemer, hath taken to himſelf of the whole maſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; he took, I ſay, one Portion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and did perfectly ſanctifie it, by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, and out of it derives perfect Holineſs and Sanctification upon all his Elect, by imputation of his Merits for their Juſtification, and by his Holy Spirit working, in them inherent Righteouſneſs and Sanctification, that ſo they may ſerve him continually in this life, and for ever.</p>
               <p>And here I will alſo ſhew you the uſe of this Article which we reaſon'd ſo much on in our Church-meetings, when we were upon the Creed, <hi>viz. I believe that he was crucified, dead and buried.</hi> All the Evangeliſts teſtifie with one accord, that this was the form of his Execution, he was crucified on a Croſs; and to fill him with pain, his hands and feet were faſtened with nayls unto the Croſs.<note place="margin">Acts 3.18. Gal. 3.1. Phil. 2.8.</note> And all this was done to accompliſh God's Eternal Decree manifeſted before by the Prophets. The brazen Serpent was a picture of this, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. For ſo he ſaith himſelf, <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98571:82"/>that all that believe in him periſh not, but may have life everlaſting.</hi> And again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32. <hi>And when I ſhall be lifted up from the Earth, I will draw all men unto my ſelf:</hi> Of this the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> Propheſied, ſaying, <hi>They pierced my hands and my feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That we might in Conſcience be reſolved that Chriſt came under the Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> and ſuffered the Curſe thereof for us, and bare in his own Body and Soul the extremity of the Wrath of God for us. And albeit other puniſhments were notes of God's Curſe, yet was the death of the Croſs in a ſpecial manner above the reſt accurſed by vertue of a particular Commandment, and ſpecial Word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by God himſelf, fore-ſeeing and fore-ſhewing what manner of Death Chriſt our Lord ſhould die.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtle aſſureth us, that in this form of Execution, we may behold how Chriſt did undertake all the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction due unto all the Elect or Mankind himſelf: for he ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 13. <hi>That he was made a Curſe for us:</hi> And again, in the like prhraſe, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1. <hi>He was made ſin for us.</hi> By which manner or ſpeaking we may not fear that any manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is offered the Son of God: For both
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98571:83"/>Sin and the Curſe following, are his by imputation. Though in regard of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he was no ſinner, yet as he was our Surety, he became ſin for us, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the curſe of the Law for us, in that the Curſe every way due unto us, by imputation and application were made his.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Inſtructions and Conſolations which follow this Faith.</head>
               <p>Firſt We learn here with bitterneſs to bewail our ſins; for Chriſt ſuffered here the Wrath of God, not for any offence that ever he committed, but all for us; and therefore juſt cauſe have we to mourn for our own ſins, which brought our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to this low and baſe eſtate. If a man ſhould be ſo far in debt that he could not be freed, unleſs the Surety ſhould be caſt into Priſon for his ſake; nay, which is more, be cruelly put to death for his debt, it would make him at his wits end, (if there were left but natural and civil huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in him) and his very heart would bleed. And this is the caſe with us; by reaſon of our ſins, we are God's debtors, yea, bankrupts before him; yet have we gotten a good Surety, even the Son of God
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98571:83"/>himſelf, who to recover us to our former liberty, was crucified and died for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of out debt. And therefore, as the Prophet ſaith, We ſhould <hi>look upon him whom we have pierced, and lament for him.</hi> Look as the blood followed the nayls that were ſtricken through the bleſſed hands and feet of Chriſt; ſo ſhould the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's Paſſion be as nayles and ſpeares to draw blood from our hands and hearts for our ſins.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If thou doubteſt where to ſee and find Chriſt crucified, becauſe the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> bids thee look on him: Be advertiſed, That he is ſet before thy face as nailed and faſtened on a Croſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his Goſpel is truly Preached in thine hearing; for ſo the Apoſtle teacheth us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Oh fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt was diſcribed in your ſight, and among you cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified?</hi> We muſt ſeek God's face in Chriſt, who is the living form or moſt bright glory, wherein we behold God himſelf: and we muſt ever ſeek Chriſt's face in the Goſpel: if we find it not there, we periſh ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. We need not go to Croſſes, nay, we muſt not go, but
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98571:84"/>to the Glaſs he hath himſelf appointed for us.<note place="margin">Note this word <hi>[till]</hi>
                  </note> And remember it, that <hi>till</hi> ſuch time as we come thus by Faith and Meditation of the Goſpel, we lie continually as poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by Satan, that old Serpent, and as ſtung to death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We learn to follow Chriſt in the purſuit and crucifying of our ſins, for ſo we are taught, <hi>Gal,</hi> 5.24. <hi>They that are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts thereof:</hi> That is, they endeavour to kill the Power of Sin in themſelves by Repentance, Prayer, Faſting, Meditation, conference with the Saints, and by avoiding all occaſions of offence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we here learn in this preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that ſeeing the Son of God was not only thus racked and crucified by men, but alſo bare the Wrath of God in his Soul; that therefore we muſt learn not to make ſo little account of ſin, as commonly we do.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Whereas the Perſon crucified was the very Son of God, it is manifeſt that the Love of God unto us in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, is endleſs; like the deep Sea without bank or bottom: as it is teſtified, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. And if we ſhall not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this to be ſo, our condemnation will be the greater.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:98571:84"/>
               <p>Sixthly, The Curſe of God being here once and fully born of the Son of God, not for himſelf, but for his Elect: It ſtandeth not with God's Juſtice to lay any Curſe on them (they continuing in the Faith) any more: wherefore when they be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their puniſhments are but temporary, and not Curſes, but Croſſes, Chaſtiſements which proceed not from Anger, as it is to the wicked, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. but from a moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Father, and ſo ever to be accounted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Now I will here declare what his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies did againſt him, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and of his Paſſions on the Croſs; what herein we be ſpecially to obſerve: Firſt, They ſtone him bot, (as many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors were executed) as <hi>Achan,</hi> Joſh. 7. and <hi>Naboth,</hi> 1 King. 21.13. but for a greater reproach, they Crucifie him, and this was the moſt ſhameful death among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Secondly, They Crucifie him after much beating, bleeding, and fainting; and ſo make his green-wounds again to lie open, even before the Sun, to his greater grief and pain. If the Son of God is Crucified for us, we muſt be content in like manner to part with all for his ſake, that we may poſſeſs him, and follow his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98571:85"/>Example. Thirdly, They pierced his hands and feet, according to the Propheſie of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.16. in thoſe parts which are moſt lively and ſenſible, and ſo the weight of his body was born up by hands and feet faſtened to the Croſs; but not in that groſs manner that blind <hi>Papiſts</hi> have imagined; but the feet nailed aſſunder with two diſtinct nailes (as Godly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients have delivered,) Fourthly, They gave him Vinegar and Gall to drink, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with Myrrh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.34. Some think to take away his ſenſes and memory intoxicating (as it were) his brain. Thus they haſtened his death,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Med.</hi> Joſ. Hall <hi>pag.</hi> 501.</note> not having any reſpect at all of his Soul, whether he died in peace and favour with God, yea or nay. Others think it was to haſten his death. Howſoever it was, every ſinner here is to be advertiſed, That it was and is he, as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> tempers, who hath tempered ſuch a Cup of Poyſon for Jeſus Chriſt. Fifthly, They Crucifie him between two Thieves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.38. for his greater ſhame, whereby they teſtifie that they eſteemed him no common ſinner,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.6.</note> but the Captain of all Thieves and Malefactors. So think thou thy ſelf with <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.15.</note> that thou art the greateſt of all ſinners. Sixthly,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98571:85"/>They all mocked him, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> wagging their heads, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiteful words againſt him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.39, 45. <hi>Thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple, and buildeſt it up in three dayes, ſave thy ſelf.</hi> And again, <hi>He ſaved others, let him ſave himſelf.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> paid dearly for this mocking and for crying, <hi>His blood be upon us and our Children:</hi> For their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren abide under the heavy wrath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for it unto this day. Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and laſtly, When the Lord Chriſt had made an end of all things, and had given full ſatisfaction to his Father's Juſtice, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his wreſtling with Satan and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and after many Paſſions in Soul and Body: He concludes all his weariſom fight with this Prayer immediately before his death: <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit,</hi> Luk 23.46. By his example he teacheth us to recommend our Spirits to the Father of Spirits. Who can preſerve any work ſo well as the crafts-maſter? And ſhall not the faithful Creator of Souls do this more carefully than man? In great dangers we commit our Jewels to our beſt Friends: ſo do thou thy Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus Chriſt, that thou mayeſt ſay with <hi>St. Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I. know whom I
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98571:86"/>have believed, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Paſſion of Chriſt is a mirrour of all Vertues, which are the more excellent for that they be ſet before us not in Rules and Doctrine, but in his own holy Practice; I ſhall name ſome of them in order.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> names ſix Vertues or ſpecial Graces proper to Chriſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates by him in ſome meaſure to all his Members, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.2. Firſt, The Spirit of <hi>Wiſdom:</hi> Secondly, Of <hi>Judgment:</hi> Thirdly, of <hi>Counſel:</hi> Fourthly, of <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:</hi> Fifthly, of <hi>Knowledge:</hi> and Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of <hi>the Fear of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, For <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> they be two ſpecial Graces; differing, as I take it, in men on this manner. The <hi>former</hi> is the general comprehenſion or knowledge of things: The <hi>later</hi> is the experience of that knowledge in particular actions. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in other things will clear this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. We ſee in Phyſick, and other Arts, many by much reading, to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſingular knowledge, ſo that they think with themſelves they could do great matters, yet when they come to have the uſe of their knowledge in ſome particular
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98571:86"/>matters, they are ſometimes, nay, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſeek, &amp; their knowledge for want of experience doth ſoon fail them. Now for the Son of God, he was ful of Wiſdom and Spiritual Underſtanding, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting his Humanity, it is teſtified of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52. that <hi>he increaſed in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> His Wiſdom did appear in the whole work of our Redemption; in fore-ſeeing and fore-ſhewing to his Apoſtles all things which ſhould happen and be done to him by the <hi>Jews;</hi> aſſuring them that this was his Fathers Will, manifeſted by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: his ſingular Judgment is to be ſeen in his preparation to that Conflict with Satan and Sinners, by Meditation and Prayer, in chuſing ſo fitly the time and place for his apprehenſion; and in all this moſt apt and fit Anſwers to all Queſtions and Demands made unto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>For Counſel:</hi> The Lord Chriſt was full of the Spirit of Counſel; for he was able to withſtand and to Anſwer all the Counſel of Hell &amp; Satan, of <hi>Annas</hi> &amp; <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> of <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> againſt him. He was ready in all temptations to Anſwer all Doubts which the Prince of Darkneſs was able to object againſt him: He was not doubtful, nor to ſeek for counſel in the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98571:87"/>whole work, nor in any part of the work of our Redemption. The Spirit of Counſel did appear notably in him in all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigmnent and Paſſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Spirit of Fortitude was in him in a moſt rich meaſure:</hi> For he wreſtled not in this action with fleſh and blood, but incountered with ſpiritual Powers and Principalities, even with all the power of Hell. This is the ſtrong Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> and the Seed of the Woman, which in his great ſtrength breaks the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. He was ſo full of Might, that with one word ſpeaking he caſt down all that came to take him, even to the ground.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>He was full of the Spirit of Knowledge to diſcern all his Enemies, and to diſcern what was in them;</hi> for ſo it is teſtified of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.14. <hi>Jeſus know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things that ſhould come unto him,</hi> &amp;c. He knew all their purpoſes, deſires, pretences, and all their deſignments.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Spirit of the Fear of the Lord he was alſo repleniſhed with;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in all his ſervice and obedience to his Heavenly Father; for he honoureth him in all his work, and faithfully performs all that ſervice in all reſpects for the which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98571:87"/>he had ſent him, ever ſeeking his glory. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.31. <hi>Now the Son of Man is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and God is glorified in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>For Humility,</hi> He is the only Patern that ever was on Earth; for this cauſe the Apoſtle willeth us to caray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us the ſame mind that was in Chriſt Jeſus; that is, the ſame Spirit of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For ſaith he, <hi>He being in the form of God, and thinking it no robbery to be equal with God; yet he made himſelf of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and took on him the form of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and was made like unto Men, and was found in ſhape as a Man: he humbled himſelf and became obedient unto the death, even the death of the Croſſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>For the Spirit of Meekneſſ:</hi> He was full of Mildneſs and Meekneſs in the whole courſe of his life, as himſelf truly teſtified of himſelf: <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28, 29. <hi>Come unto me all that are heavy laden, and I will eaſe you: Take my yoke on you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart; and ye ſhall find reſt unto your Souls.</hi> This vertue did notably appear in his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: For the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in him: <hi>He was oppreſſed and afflicted, yet did he not open bis mouth.</hi> For ſo we ſind it teſtified; for when falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98571:88"/>urged him, and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> yet he was ſilent, becauſe he was willing to die, and there was no place to ſpeak, either for the<note n="*" place="bottom">When to ſpeak.</note> Glory of God, or the good of Men.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, As St. <hi>James</hi> commends <hi>Job</hi> for <hi>Patience;</hi> ſo much more may the Son of God be recommended as a Mirrour of Patience to all the World: for he was ſoft in his Anſwers, &amp; calm in his Speeches to all his moſt bloody Enemies; to <hi>Judas</hi> betraying him with a kiſs, he ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.50. <hi>Friend, wherefore art thou come?</hi> And to the High Prieſts Officers which ſmote him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.23. <hi>If I have evil ſpoken, bear witneſs of the evil, but if I have well ſpoken, why ſmiteſt thou me? Herod</hi> thought him a Fool for his Silence and Patience; whereby we be taught in all unjuſt Railings and Injuries not to give rebuke, but either to keep ſilence, or elſe to ſpeak ſo much as ſhall be for our juſt defence.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, He was full of <hi>Love, Mercy, and Compaſſion,</hi> in the midſt of his Paſſions, even to his Enemies: He cured <hi>Malchus's</hi> ear, which <hi>Peter</hi> had cut off with his Sword. And when they were practiſing againſt him all treachery, even then he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the work of a Mediator, praying
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98571:88"/>for them unto his Father, ſaying, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do:</hi> For his Friends, he is moſt mindful of them, and loving unto them, even in his greateſt Paſſions: In his Apprehenſion, he deſireth his Diſciples might be let go freely; <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.8. <hi>If ye ſeek me, let theſe go their way.</hi> As for <hi>Peter,</hi> after he had renounced lam with bitter execrations, he turned back, and looked graciouſly on him, and quickened him again, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.61. He ſhewed mercy on the Thief which did hang by him on the Croſs; comforting him in theſe words, <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, To day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> verſ. 43.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, He recommends his Mother to the cuſtody of <hi>John,</hi> Joh. 19.26, 27. where he teacheth Children to give all Honour, and to perform all duties of Love, Care, and Reverence to their Parents.</p>
               <p>Finally, We find in Chriſt's Paſſion, a notable preſident for <hi>Perſeverence:</hi> For he wades through all the Sea of his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, he never ſlinks back, nor turns aſide to reſt him, till he comes to the very end of all his weariſom race; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the torments and tears he had within and without, yet he reſted not till
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98571:89"/>he came to the mark he ſet before him, then he cryed, <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> all my work is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; and ſo he departed from evil Men and evil Angels unto God, and unto the Spirits of Righteous Men, and Holy Angels.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ſee in his Paſſion the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of many moſt excellent vertues; whereby he did not only gain Merits to ſave us, but alſo gave ſpecial Inſtructions to guide and direct us in the whole courſe of our life.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have declared my Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Paſſion of Chriſt under <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> and now I will ſhew you what I believe concerning his Death.</p>
               <p>I do believe that he died; I believe his death was not a fiction or imaginary death, but a true death indeed, according to the Propheſies which were before delivered concerning him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>He was cut off from the Land of the living.</hi> Dan. 9. <hi>The Meſſiah ſhall be cut off.</hi> The Types and Sacrifices of Lambs daily in the Temple, did fore-ſhew and preach the death of the Lamb of God. The accompliſhment and truth of the Types and Propheſies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded faithfully, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. &amp; <hi>ch.</hi> 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26 &amp; 27 <hi>Chapters, Mark</hi> 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.26.</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:98571:89"/>
               <p>Firſt, He died to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for the Elect, that he might free them from death, and from the fear of death, as it is written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Foraſmuch as the Children were partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part with them, that he might deſtroy through death him that had Power over death, that is the Devil; and that he might deliver all them, which for fear of death were all their life time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, He died to fulfil all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God from the beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſay, his death was voluntary and an accurſed death: Firſt, voluntary, for ſo he ſpeaketh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi> Secondly, It was an accurſed death: for ſo it is written, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe for us:</hi> and how? He ſheweth it in the words following, <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</hi> As if he ſhould avouch in effect, that Chriſt's death was accurſed; that is, that it contained in it the firſt death; that is, the ſeparation of Body and Soul; for that for a time he did apprehend and undergo the wrath of God due to Man for ſin, yet
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98571:90"/>was he never out of God's favour; for, in the midſt of his loud cryes, he calls God his God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. He was never ſo oppreſſed of death as the damned are: For, as he ſuffered the bodily death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any corruption of body, ſo be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the extream pangs of the Soul; but not as forſaken of God, more than in his own apprehenſion and feeling.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Comfort and Uſe we have of this Faith; or, the Bleſſings we reap by the death of Chriſt are many, and very precious, never to be forgotten of true-hearted Believers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This voluntary and true obedience of Chriſt unto death, even this accurſed death, is our Righteouſneſs before God, as it is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by the diſobedience of one man many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one</hi> Righteous, <hi>many are made Righteous.</hi> In this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt's Death lyeth the chief matter of all our felicity and rejoycing, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould rejoyce in any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> There is no one thing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in ſo many and ſo evident Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies than this: So by the Death of Chriſt, I am freed from the ſecond Death.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:98571:90"/>
               <p n="2">2. By this Faith in Chriſt crucified and dead for us, I behold to my exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfort, a divine proportion between the infinite debt of God's Elect, and the ſatisfaction done by the death of Chriſt unto God's Juſtice for the ſame, as infinite as the debt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſee the unſpeakable love of God to his Elect, continually preached unto me, and manifeſted as before mine eyes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſee that God's Divine Juſtice is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by Chriſt's Death, in the ſame Nature which offended him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. to mine exceeding great conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. My trembling Conſcience by this Faith is quiet and pacified, for I feel here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that the pollution of my Conſcience is done away, becauſe my heart is ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. and the ſcorching heat of it is abated by this Water of Life, which ſtreams unto my heart from the ſide and heart of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10, 11. &amp; 13.1.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The firſt Death by Chriſt is turned into a bleſſing, and made unto me a gate of Life: So that now I may truly ſay, That the day of Death is better unto me,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98571:91"/>(I being in Chriſt) than the day wherein I was born.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Death of Chriſt doth ratifie his laſt Will and Teſtament unto me. Thus it pleaſed the Father to make authentical and to ſeal unto me the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16.</p>
               <p n="8">8. By his Death he hath not only taken away the condemnation of ſin (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.) for us, but alſo hath broken the power and infection of it in us. The act of Chriſt's Death is paſt, but the vertue and powet thereof endures forever: When we have Grace to deny our ſelves, and to put our truſt in Chriſt, and by Faith hold him faſt in our hearts: then as Chriſt himſelf by the Power of his Godhead overcame Death, Hell, and Damnation in himſelf for us, ſo ſhall we by the ſame Power of his Godhead and Grace dwelling in us; <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. crucifie the fleſh with the affections and luſts thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25, 26.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Death of Chriſt ought to be to all impenitent Sinners, the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to move them, and turn them unto Chriſt, and to humble them, becauſe they have pierced him by their ſins: This I ſay ought to cauſe them to mourn for him (as
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98571:91"/>the Prophet <hi>Zechary</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.10.) whom even they themſelves, and not the <hi>Jews</hi> only, have wounded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this move them not, their caſe is dangerous.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Be ready, if thou beeſt a Believer, to lay down thy life for Chriſt, (if need ſo require) as he hath done for thee, and to die rather than to do any thing which thou knoweſt manifeſtly to be contrary to his Will: Of this mind were all the Martyrs and Faithful People of God in all Ages.</p>
               <p n="11">11. To give ſome ſpecial Inſtructions: if it be doubted, what the Altar was whereon Chriſt offered his Sacrifice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> avouch it to be the Croſs: I believe rather, that Chriſt himſelf was the Prieſt, the Sacrifice, and the Altar, as I ſaid before: the Sacrifice, as he is Man; the Prieſt, as he is both God and Man; the Altar, as he is God: For the property of an Altar is to ſanctifie the Sacrifice, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.9. Now Chriſt as he was God, ſanctifieth himſelf as he was Man: <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19. <hi>For their ſakes ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie I my ſelf:</hi> And this he did, Firſt, By ſetting apart his Manhood to be a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto his Father for our ſins: Secondly,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98571:92"/>By giving unto his Sacrifice merit and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy to be a meritorious Sacrifice: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wooden-Croſs was not his Altar, as Papiſts have imagined.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> ſaith, that the ſecond Temple built by <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> was nothing in beauty unto the firſt which was built by <hi>Solomon:</hi> For it wanted five things which the firſt Temple had: Firſt, The Appearing and Preſence of God at the Mercy-Seat between the two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims: Secondly, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> on the Breſt-plate of the High Prieſt: Thirdly, The Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt upon extraordinary Prophets: Fourthly, The Ark of the Covenant which was loſt in the Captivity: Fifthly, Fire from Heaven to burn their Sacrifices. And yet notwithſtanding all this loſs, the ſame Prophet, in the ſame <hi>Chapt.</hi> the 10th <hi>verſ.</hi> following, aſſureth, <hi>That the Glory of the laſt Houſe ſhould be greater than the firſt:</hi> Becauſe the Sacrifice of Chriſt at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſhould give Glory and Dignity to it: And for that his Preſence, Preaching, and Teaching in it, gave it more Glory than the former five ſpecial Graces and Gifts of God did or could give unto the firſt Temple. So I believe that <hi>Chriſt died
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98571:92"/>and was buried, and roſe again the third day, according to the Scriptures,</hi> Rom. 4.25. <hi>He died for our ſins, and roſe again for our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.3, 4, 14.</p>
               <p>Now I will ſpeak of the manner of his Reſurrection, and the Uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Lord Jeſus being truly dead and buried, roſe again by his own Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power; as is often teſtified, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. <hi>No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf; I have power to lay it down, and have power to take, it again.</hi> And ſo his Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> aſſure us, he quickned himſelf by his own Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. whereby he doth approve himſelf comfortable unto us to be the very Son of God, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> noteth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. ſaying, <hi>He was declared mightily to be the Son of God, touching the Spirit of Sanctification, by the reſurrection from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As touching the form he roſe in, or how his body was qualified. I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Thar after his Reſurrection his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was glorified richly, yea, moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly qualified with ſupernatural Graces: His body was incorruptible, and it was made a ſhining body, a reſemblance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome of his Diſciples ſaw in the Mount:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98571:93"/>and it was indued with Agility to move as well upward as downward, as may appear by the Aſcention of his Body to Heaven, which was not cauſed by conſtraint, or by any violent Motive, but by a property a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to all bodies glorified.</p>
               <p>Yet, in the exaltation of Chriſt's Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, we muſt remember two Caveats; Firſt, he did never lay aſide the Eſſential Properties of a true Body, as length, breadth, thickneſs, viſibility, locality, or to be in one place at once, and no more, but keeping all this ſtill, becauſe they ſerve for the Being of his Body. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We muſt remember, that the gifts of Glory in Chriſt's Body are not infinite, but finite: for his Humane Nature being but a Creature, and therefore finite, could not receive infinite Graces, &amp;c. Chriſt's Body is not Omnipotent and Infinite: for this is to affirm he had no Humane Body, and to make the Creature the Creator. That it might appear unto his Diſciples he had a glorious Body and was changed: he was not alwayes in their preſence, but came often ſuddenly into their preſence: and once the doors being ſhut, the doors giving place, and being opened, as ſaith<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> upon the Creed. <hi>pag. 275.</hi>
                  </note> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> they knew not how: He
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98571:93"/>that thickned the Water to walk on, can cauſe Doors and Locks to give way unto his coming, without any piercing or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through them, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
               <p>Finally, That he had a true Body, a real Body, the very ſame wherein he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not a feigned body (as Hereticks have avouched) is teſtified by many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments unto us; he ſhewed ſome ſcars, wounds, and blemiſhes of his Paſſion, in his Body now glorified, as then remaining for the confirmation of men: and to this end he converſed with men: He did eat and drink often in the preſence of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles after his Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this Article concerning Chriſt's Reſurrection, and of this Faith, is this; Firſt, The Reſurrection of Chriſt is a publick teſtimony, that he hath perfect Righteouſneſs for all ſuch as truſt in him: and if there had remained but one of our ſins either unperfectly puniſhed in him, or not fully ſatisfied by him, he could not aſſuredly then have riſen from the death; for where but one ſin is, there muſt be death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. as God hath decreed. Like as then the Father by delivering Chriſt to death, hath indeed condemned
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98571:94"/>our ſins in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. ſo by raiſing him from death, he hath abſolved Chriſt from our ſins, and us in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. As our ſins are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and puniſhed in the death of Chriſt: ſo our abſolution and diſcharge is in his Reſurrection: Chriſt was given to death for our ſins, and raiſed again for our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Believer is truly ſaid to be dead to ſin; or to be dead with Chriſt: becauſe the vertue of Chriſt's death works effectually in his heart the death or ſin: and next to be buried with Chriſt into his death;<note place="margin">Rom. 6.2, 3, 4.</note> becauſe of the vertue which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Chriſt's burial to cauſe him ſo to bury ſin, that it never can riſe up any more to be ſo ſtirring in him, as it was before he came co Chriſt. And laſtly, The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is as truly ſaid to be riſen with Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. becauſe a ſpecial Vertue and Grace proceeds alſo from Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to the believing heart, to quicken it unto newneſs of life. And this is that Grace which the Apoſtle deſires more and more to feel and find to abound in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he deſires to know Chriſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the vertue of his Reſurrection, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. wherefore we muſt imbrace
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98571:94"/>Chriſt riſen in the arms of our precious Faith, and ſo apply him unto our hearts, that we may ſenſibly feel vertue to come from him, not only to crucifie our old Affections, but alſo to ſtir up daily, new, holy, and heavenly Affections in our hearts: <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>We art regenerate to a lively hope, by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> As it was in the cure of the Woman that had the Bloody Iſſue: ſo it is in the curing and quickning of ſinners, which are full of Bloody Iſſues; all which muſt be ſtanched and cured by a certain vertue derived from Chriſt into them, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.29, 30. This is the Prayer, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The third fruit which is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſecond, is the aſſurance of our perſeverance in Grace, and of our full vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory againſt Sin and Death; for they that are ingraſted into Chriſt by Faith, and continuing therein unto death, draw from him ſuch a ſpiritual Life and Power, as they ſhall never loſe, no not in the parting aſunder of Soul and Body. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.51. <hi>If any Man keep my Woad, he ſhall never ſee death.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:98571:95"/>
               <p>Fourthly, The laſt benefit of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is the reſurrection of our bodies. The truth is this; That good and bad ſhall riſe again, yet there is a great difference in the riſing of the one and the other; for the Godly ſhall riſe by vertue of Chriſt's Reſurrection, and that to Eternal Glory: But the Ungodly riſe by the Power of Chriſt as he is a terrible Judge, and to execute Juſtice on them. Now to the Faithful, Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>the firſt fruits of them that ſleep,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.16. Becauſe as in the firſt Fruits of Corn being offered unto God, the owner had an aſſurance of God's bleſſing on the reſt: So here by Chriſt's Reſurrection the Believers have a Pledge of their own reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Now of his Aſcention into Heaven: <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. That <hi>he was taken up:</hi> the meaning is, this was done prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by the mighty Power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and partly by the ſupernatural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a glorified Body, which is to move as well upward as downward with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſtraint or violence. And thus Chriſt aſcended into Heaven really and actually, and not in appearance only. And he went alſo locally by changing his place, and going from Earth to Heaven, ſo as he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98571:95"/>is no more on Earth bodily, as we are now on Earth.</p>
               <p>And whereas it may be doubted, <hi>If he be ſo departed from us, at touching hit bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preſence how that may be true, that he ſaid he would be with us unto the end of the World?</hi> Matth. 28.20.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Anſwer</hi> is; He ſaid alſo, That <hi>he would leave the Word to go to the Father Joh.</hi> 16.28. wherefore he muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to ſpeak by a diſtinction. True it is, he was before <hi>Abraham, Joh.</hi> 8.85. and ſo is he with the Church to the Worlds end, according to his Divine Nature, in Majeſty, Grace, Vertue, Power, and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual working of his Holy Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11. &amp; 14.16, 17. &amp; 16.13. But his bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preſence is in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If any doubt further, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Natures be not thus ſevered, if where the one it, the other is not alwayes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> No: For the Divinity which cannot be comprehended, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out-reach, and yet comprehend the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and thereunto be perſonally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It is not alwayes that of two things conjoyned, where the one is, there muſt be the other alſo. For the Sun and his beams are both joyned together, yet they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98571:96"/>are not both in all places together; for the body of the Sun is ſeated and carried only in his Celeſtial Orbe in the Heavens, but his beames are here beneath on the Earth. In thoſe Holy Phraſes then we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that (as Learned Men ſpeak) the Properties of both Natures muſt be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in Chriſt, for in ſuch places, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties belonging to one Nature, are aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the other, becauſe of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical Union of both Natures in one Perſon. — And thus far for the ſenſe of the words of this Article; where we ſee briefly that Chriſt's Aſcention is an Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a receiving up of his Humanity to fit in the higheſt Heavens, till the glorious day of his Appearance in Judgment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the uſe of this Faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When I do thus believe the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Chriſt, I do believe alſo all the Effects thereof, and all the Holy Adjuncts appertaining thereunto: namely, theſe two principal, which the Apoſtle ſpecially men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8, 12. Firſt, that <hi>when he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive.</hi> By Captivity, I underſtand a multitude of Captives, as the Pſalmiſt doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.19. By Captives here are meant the World,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98571:96"/>the Fleſh, Sin, Satan, and Death it ſelf: and whatſoever Engins and Confederates theſe had againſt Chriſt in his Humiliation, and his Members all their dayes on Earth; He ſo triumphed over them all on his Croſs;, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. but eſpecially in his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, that howſoever they may fear us otherwhile, and ſcar us to waken us from Security; yet they ſhall never hurt us, for Chriſt hath taken away their ſting, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. and hath pinioned their hands behind them as Captives and ſet us Free, if we will come unto him when he calls us by his Goſpel. Wherefore if we refuſe now his Call, our ſtate is the more dangerous.<note place="margin">See Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> upon the Creed. <hi>pag. 285.</hi>
                  </note> A man lies bound hand and foot in a dark Dungeon, and the Keeper ſets open the Priſon door, takes off his Irons, and bids him come forth: If he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, and ſay he is well, may it not be ſaid he is mad, and who will pity him in that caſe. This is the ſtate of all impenitents, and contemners of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is ſaid alſo. <hi>That then he gave gifts to his Church,</hi> as Kings do in their triumph; and his gifts were thoſe, <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Teachers, for the planting of the Church, and the Propagation of the ſame,</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:98571:97"/>and <hi>for the gathering of his Elect to the Worlds end.</hi> If theſe were Chriſt's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal bleſſings which Chriſt gave his Church in his Aſcenſion, and ſo richly and highly to be accounted, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and ſent for ſo great a Work as the building of the Body of Chriſt, which is his Church on Earth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12. Then they do not believe rightly and truly the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, that ſo baſely and vilely eſteem the ſacred Miniſtry and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Adminiſtration of his Sacraments, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and all carnal Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Like as our Juſtification is aſcribed unto his Reſurrection and Merit of the ſame: So our proceeding in Grace and Perſeverance may truly be attributed to his Aſcenſion to Heaven, and Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there for us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. And like as he could never have riſen in that Body wherein he was accurſed for us, unleſs he had been acquitted, and juſtified from all our ſins: ſo much leſs could he have Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into the higheſt Heavens, if he had not been pure from all our ſpots imputed unto him: His Aſcenſion is a clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.9 10.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98571:97"/>and conſequently, of our Righteouſneſs in him, and by him; for which theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are ſweetly knit together for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our Faith, touching our free Juſtification by Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? Is God that juſtifieth: who ſhall condemn? It is Chriſt which died, yea, or rather which is riſen again, who is alſo at the right-hand of God, and maketh requeſt for us.</hi> Wherefore ever remember to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Doctrine of Antichriſt, who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Chriſt by his Death did merit our Juſtification, but we once Juſtified, do further merit our Salvation. Whereas thou feeſt here, not only the beginning, but alſo the continuance, yea, the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the whole Work of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in our Vocation, Juſtification, Sanctification, and Glorification, is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and only to be aſcribed to the merit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We receive alſo by his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, a confirmation touching our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion into Heaven; for in believing the one, we believe the other: for the Head and Members muſt go together. We be not now coldly to look for Heaven, but by lively Hope to poſſeſs it: for that we
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98571:98"/>poſſeſs it in our Head already. For this cauſe it is written, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. <hi>That God hath made us to ſit together in Heavenly places in Chriſt.</hi> He hath there a Pledge for us, even our fleſh, and we again by his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion have received from him an heavenly Pledge, even his Spirit: <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.7. <hi>I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you, that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not come unto you.</hi> 2 Cor. 1.22. <hi>He hath ſealed us, and given us the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TIES.</head>
               <p>Firſt, That our Converſation be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where Chriſt is. Our Hearts, our Thoughts, our Words, our Works, our whole Converſation muſt be ſuch, as if we converſed already with the Angels in the higheſt Heavens.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we believe we be poſſeſt of Heaven in Chriſt; we muſt ſtrive to enter into him with holy Contention of Spirit, uſing the means he hath appointed, that we may come unto him with all the good-ſpeed we can. If we be aſſured of his Purchaſe made for us by his Blood, we muſt paſs through all dangers to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and unto it; and not only contend to get in our ſelves, but alſo endeavour to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98571:98"/>bring with us all we can, ſpecially all ſuch as God by near bands of Love hath knit unto us; as our Wives and Children, &amp;c. providing as much as in us lyeth, that they may be with us, Heirs together of the ſame Grace of life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In all grievances of Body and Mind, ſeek to no means for eaſe, but only to the Comforter, and the means he hath appointed and ordained in the Word. If thou believeſt the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this was one end of his Aſcenſion, to ſend down the Holy Ghoſt to work more effectually, and comfortably in the hearts of his Children. And therefore endeavour in and by the Word and Sacraments to be comforted by him, in all affliction of this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I believe that Chriſt sitteth at the right hand of God, &amp;c.</hi> Here two things muſt be underſtood: Firſt,<note place="margin">Note.</note> That this bleſſed Perſon of the Son hath the ſame equality of Majeſty and Glory with the Father: Secondly, By this phraſe is alſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the Humane Nature of Chriſt is exalted to a moſt high excellency of Glory, even to execute Judgment as he is the Son of Man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.27.— And it may not be here ſaid, is in the Reſurrection; That
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98571:99"/>like as Chriſt roſe only in reſpect of his Humane Nature, ſo alſo he ſits at Gods right hand in reſpect of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for the ſeſſion an God's right hand is not a property of Nature, but ſignifieth the ſtate of the Perſon of Chriſt, reſting now in the execution of his Offices, as being King, Prieſt, and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and his People.</p>
               <p>The Benefits which follow this Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Seſſion of Chriſt, at the right hand of God, are either in reſpect of his Prieſthood, or of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Believer gains theſe benefits by his Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is now, and may be truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that as the Covenant of Grace and Prieſthood of Chriſt have no end;<note place="margin">Heb. 8.6. 1 Tim. 2.5. 1 Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.1. Joh. 17.</note> ſo his Interceſſion for him, and for all and every Believer, ſhall never ceaſe to the end of the World, for all. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Chriſt is riſen again, and ſitttth at the right hand of God, and maketh requeſt for us, and for every one. I have prayed for thee, Peter, that they Faith fail not.</hi> The manner of this is thus: He appears in Heaven as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Perſon in our ſtead: He appears in the ſight of God for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. and makes the ſame Requeſts he made on Earth, <hi>Joh.</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:98571:99"/>17. The difference between Chriſt's Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Interceſſion is this: The Paſſion is a ſatisfaction to God's Juſtice for us, &amp;c. and as it were the tempering of a Plaiſter: but Interceſſion applyes it to the very ſore. So then the Believer is hereby ſweetly comforted in heart, being perſwaded that Chriſt Jeſus, God and Man, (now ſitting in great Majeſty and Glory in Heaven) Firſt, hears his Prayers in Heaven: And Secondly, accepts and ſanctifies all his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and Service, which the Believer offers to the Father by his hand, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106. for all our Service is imperfect, yet for his Interceſſion ſake it is accepted as perfect.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Conſolation here ariſes to the believing heart: he may now with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs go to the Throne of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. becauſe we have there an High Prieſt that ſitteth at the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1. And for this cauſe the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.19, 20. biddeth us draw near, with a true heart, and with an undoubted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Faith. And again moſt ſweetly, <hi>Phil</hi> 4.6. <hi>Be careful for nothing, but in all things let your requeſts be ſhewed unto God in Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:98571:100"/>
               <p>A third Conſolation is this: His Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion preſerves every Repenting Sinner in the ſtate of Grace: that being once Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and Sanctified, they may ſo continue unto the end.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A moſt ſweet Conſolation in this: The Interceſſion of Chriſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven caſteth down ſuch beams of Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Believers heart on Earth, that it cauſeth another Interceſſion of the Spirit in him; or cauſeth the Spirit of Prayer to be effectual and working in him: <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10, 11.<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. He giveth us his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which helpeth our infirmities, and maketh Requeſt for us, with ſighs and groans that cannot be expreſſed; but he which ſearcheth the heart knoweth what is the meaning of the Spirit, for he maketh Requeſt for the Saints according to the Will of God. The Holy Ghoſt makes Requeſt by ſtirring every repenting heart to pray with groans and ſighs, which the mouth cannot expreſs: and this is a ſpecial fruit of the Interceſſion of Chriſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. So that a Man may ſoon know by the Spirit of Prayer in his own heart, how Chriſt prayeth for him in Heaven. A Man may ſoon find it by his own coldneſs, or fervency in Prayer; or by the inward
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98571:100"/>groans of his heart, when he cannot ſo well expreſs his grief in words before God.</p>
               <p>Here I renounce the Opinion of <hi>Papiſts</hi> touching Interceſſion, as being Heretical, uncomfortable, and condemned of God: Firſt, For that the Saints departed (who be their Mediators with Angels) know not our particular wants and griefs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, For that he that makes this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, muſt bring ſomething of his own, of price and value, unto God, to procure the grant of his Requeſt. Thirdly, It is a Prerogative belonging only to Chriſt, to make Requeſt in his own Name, and for his own Merits. Fourthly, Scriptures ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mention any other, but contrarily. Fifthly, We muſt Pray to him in whom we believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. We believe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one God, &amp;c. therefore we pray only to one God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, As touching his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we are well to conſider what King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he hath; next, what the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Kingdom is, and how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to the Believers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That he is Lord and King over all in reſpect of Creation, as alſo of Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Providence, it is manifeſt; <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>For by him were all things
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98571:101"/>created in Heaven and Earthy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and in him all things conſiſt:</hi> He is the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo much more by right of Redemption. And his Kingdom is Eternal and Spiritual, reſpecting the very Conſcience, having that only abſolute Power to Command and Forbid, to Condemn and to Abſolve the Soul and Conſcience. This is teſtified, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>Let all Iſrael know for a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that God hath made him both Lord and Chriſt, this Jeſus</hi> (I ſay) <hi>whom ye have crucified.</hi> And to teſtifie this his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; when Chriſt went up to ſit on his Throne for the Government of his Church, it is ſaid, He gave great gifts to his Church, far excelling the gifts of Earthly Princes in their Coronations: for (it is ſaid) He gave his Church <hi>Apoſties, Prophets, Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> Eph. 4.11, 12. Now the End and Uſe of theſe Gifts and Benefits given by this Great King is comfortable: for there it is ſaid, That theſe were given for the Collecting of his Church, and the Building of it:<note place="margin">Luk. 11.13 Acts 16.6, 9. Iſa. 11.2, 3, 4, 5. Acts 2.32, 33.</note> This Collection is a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Precious from the Vile, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19. and a tranſlation of Men from the kingdom of Darkneſs into the Kingdom of Light, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9, 10,11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2, 3. by the Miniſtry and Diſpenſation of the Word
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98571:101"/>of Reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. outwardly, and the working of the Holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. And this is the firſt part of Chriſt's Office in his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt leads his precious People as a great General doth his Army, through the Wilderneſs of this World, into his everlaſting <hi>Canaan.</hi> And this he doth alſo by the ſame means, whereby he called them by his Word and Sacraments outwardly, the mighty operation of his Spirit inwardly. And in this Travel, he doth Exerciſe them (as in <hi>Canaan</hi>) with manifold Afflictions and Temptations in this life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. and yet defends them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rage of all Enemies: Firſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in their life-time ſtrength to ſuffer, and to fight againſt all his Enemies moſt mightily. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Unto you it is given for Chriſt, that not only ye ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, but alſo ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> Chap. 4.13. <hi>I am able to do all things through him which ſtrengthneth me.</hi> Rom. 8.36, 37. <hi>For thy ſake we are killed all the day long, we are counted at Sheep for the ſlaughter; Nevertheleſs, in all theſe things we are more than Conquerors, through him that loved us.</hi> And in death it ſelf, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſakes them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. but then
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98571:102"/>makes an everlaſting Separation between them and all their Enemies, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall ſpeak ſomething to the laſt Article concerning Chriſt, which is this: <hi>From thence he ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, this Article follows fitly after the former for confirmation of it: For the excellency of his Kingdom ſhall mightily and wonderfully appear in the execution of Juſtice, in the great day of the general Judgment which ſhall be in the laſt day of the World. Firſt, to Judge, or to give Judgment is the proper Action and Function of a Judge, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, or Juſtifying of any Man. In Condemning, by pronouncing him guilty of Sin; and therefore adjudging him to ſome puniſhment for his Sin. In Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by pronouncing him juſt, or acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him of Sin, and ſo freeing him from the puniſhment of Sin. I ſay then the meaning of this Article is this: I believe that Jeſus Chriſt doth not only now exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Kingly Office in Heaven (as is afore-ſhewed) but ſhall alſo triumphantly deſcend from the right-hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98571:102"/>in a viſible form, and corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to judge all men that ſhall be found at his coming alive or dead.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed in order to ſpeak of this great Judgment, theſe Points muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: Firſt, By what Arguments it may appear that there ſhall be a general Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, What the form and manner thereof ſhall be. Thirdly, How this Argument ſerves to comfort us, and to humble us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there ſhall be an Univerſal Judgement, may appear thus, againſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villers that deny it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 8.17. Joh. 12.48 Jud. 14.15 2 Tim. 4.1, 7, 8. Joh. 5.22, 27.</note> The Scriptures are moſt evident for this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.1. <hi>The God of Gods hath ſpoken, and called all the Earth from the riſing of the Sun to the ſetting of the ſame: our God ſhall come and ſhall not keep ſilence.</hi> Heb. 9.27. <hi>It is appointed unto Men that they ſhall once die, and after that cometh the Judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt promiſeth his coming to Judgment by himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31. and by his Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For that he hath charged us to wait for his Coming,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23 Eph. 1.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.28. and for the Redemption of our bodies, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.28.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:98571:103"/>
               <p>Fourthly, For that the Juſtice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God requires this, to puniſh the Wicked, and to crown the Godly, which we ſee is not in this preſent life, therefore there is a ſpecial day and time appointed with God for it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, For that the Lord hath often forewarned the World of this. Firſt, By pronouncing the ſentence of death againſt ſin, even before the Fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, By repeating the ſame ſentence in his Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. Thirdly, By the evidence of Conſcience, citing, as it were, Men to appear at a time appointed before the great Judge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15, 16. Fourthly, By his Judgments particularly on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah,</hi> on <hi>Egypt,</hi> on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all the <hi>Jews,</hi> and generally on the <hi>World</hi> in the deluge.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The preparation unto Judgement. Firſt, Before his Coming, preparation ſhall be made by fire. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.3. <hi>A fire ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour before him,</hi> (as we heard before out of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.7, 10, 11, 12.) for Heaven and Earth muſt paſs through a fire; not to conſume them to nothing (for then where ſhould Chriſt appear in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Sinners muſt be Judged on the Earth, and in the place where they have
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98571:103"/>ſinned) but to conſume their Leproſie and Corruption, wherewith the ſin of Man hath infected Heaven and Earth, and ſo being as Gold purified in fire, they may ſhine bright and glorious, and may be fit to entertain the Majeſty of this great King at his glorious Coming to Judgement: for as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. It is the figure or form, not the Nature or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the World that paſſeth away. The ſame is teſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. <hi>The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the of the Sons of God.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.27, 28. <hi>The Heavens ſhall wax old,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſhall be changed,</hi> meaning into a better ſtate: as other Scriptures alſo teſtifie; <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.17. &amp; 66.22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Then ſhall be the appearing of the Glory of the Mighty God, and of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall come from the higheſt Heavens, accompanied with an exceeding great Hoſt of mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Souls of righteous men. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Then ſhall be heard the ſound of a Trumpet, a wonderful piercing and long continuing ſound, ſummoning all Men and Angels unto Judgment.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:98571:104"/>
               <p>Fourthly, The good Angels ſhall gather all Nations, and bring all unto the place of Judgement; all (I ſay) the living and the dead, for the very dead ſhall firſt be called out of their Graves, and they ſhall come cloathed with their own bodies. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. And with them ſhall appear all that be alive, changed in a moment in the twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye: and corruptible bodies ſhall become incorruptible, natural ſhall be turned into ſpiritual, living immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the vertue and Power of God. And the bodies of the Saints ſhall be like the glorious Body of Chriſt, ſhining as the Sun, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.43. And the Wicked ſhall be full of ſhame and diſhonour. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. The evil Angels alſo, they are reſerved for the Judgement of the great day, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. And then Antichriſt, the Son of Perdition, ſhall appear in his colours, who ſhall be conſumed and waſted continually by the Spirit of Chriſt, preaching in the Goſpel, but his final aboliſhing and perdition ſhall be at the glorious Coming of Chriſt. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 7.8.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Then ſhall Chriſt ſit in his Throne of Judgement:<note place="margin">Note.</note> as the Evangeliſts ſpeak, <hi>Then ſhall he ſit upon the Throne of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98571:104"/>his Glory,</hi> Matth. 25.31. and <hi>this Throne ſhall be like a flame of fire,</hi> Dan. 7.9. So that the Wicked ſhall deſire the Mountains to cover them from the ſight of it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, This done, the Lord wall make ſeparation between the Elect and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate: as he doth here on Earth in the Church make ſeparation between the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and the Vile, by the fame of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel preached:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Confer</hi> Mat. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> Jer. 15.</note> So will he by his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Voice and Miniſtry of his Angels, make a final ſeparation in that day between the one and the other. The Sheep which heard his Voice and teſtified their Faith by their innocency, like Lambs, they ſhall ſtand on his right hand: They which contrarily teſtifie their Unbelief by their laſciviouſneſs and luſts like Goates,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.18.</note> ſhall be ſet on his left hand.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Every man's particular cauſe ſhall be tryed before this Judge by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which his Works ſhall give with him, or againſt him; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, that every man may receive the things which are done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:98571:105"/>
               <p>Here, the better to aſſure us of the truth and certainty of the Lord's proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and of his particularizing of all things in this action; the Holy Ghoſt tells us, that the Lord hath, as it were, Books of Record to manifeſt all and every Work of Man; and his Books be Three in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>His Book of Providence,</hi> which is the knowledge of all particular things, paſt, preſent, and to come, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>His Book of Judgement,</hi> which is divided, as it were into two parts: Firſt, His Preſcience, or knowing every thing far more evidently than we know any thing recorded ii a Book before our eyes. Secondly, The ſecond part of the Book of Judgement, is the Conſcience of every man ſtanding before him, which ſhall then be ſo qualified by the great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, that it ſhall be able to record and teſtifie ſo much of all his particulars as ſhall ſerve to teſtifie his Faith and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Chriſt, or his moſt juſt Condemnation without Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The third Book is <hi>The Book of Life,</hi> which is the Eternal Decree of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98571:105"/>the Salvation of all Believers by Chriſt; whoſe Names be written in this Book, that they (being as God's precious Pearls) of this Book, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.3. &amp; <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32. and of this diſtinction of Books; <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. <hi>And I ſaw the dead both great and ſmall ſtand before God, and the Books were opened: and another Book was opened which is the Book of Life, and the dead were judged of thoſe things which were written in the Books, according to their Works.</hi> And after that men's Works are made manifeſt by theſe Books, then muſt they be tryed whether they be good or evil; the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> that never heard of Chriſt, by the Law of Nature, which ſhall prove them inexcuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12, 16. The reſt that have heard, ſhall be tryed by the Law and Goſpel, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. The Word of God ſhall ſerve as a Bill of Indictment for the juſt Condemnation of all ſuch as have contemned the Law and Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Joh. 12.48</note> For the Sentence of the Judge in the laſt day of general Judgment ſhall be nothing elſe but a manifeſtation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Sentence pronounced and publiſhed before by the Miniſtry and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98571:106"/>of the Goſpel touching the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Condemnation of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon. Now after the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things, and that every particular Conſcience ſees his bleſſed Juſtification by Chriſt, or his juſt Condemnation by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and for his Works; then the Judge ſhall proceed to his definitive Sentence: and this is two-fold.</p>
               <p>The firſt is pronounced to the Elect in theſe words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you before the beginning of the World:</hi> This Sentence is full of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and love, moſt ſweet and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, recommending the free Grace of God, their Election, their Adoption, and Bleſſedneſs in Chriſt, and not their Works, for the cauſe of their Salvation: and then he addeth the Evidence of their Faith, by the works of Mercy which they have done to his Members here on Earth; <hi>I was hungery, and you gave me to eat,</hi> &amp;c. The Anſwer of the Saints, ſaying, <hi>When ſaw we thee an hungry,</hi> &amp;c. argues that they are far from vain glory in their Works, or ſeeking any Juſtification by them, and Chriſt's laſt words to them,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98571:106"/>
                  <hi>Inaſmuch as you did it to the leaſt of theſe my Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. gives us an infailable Argument of God's Child, which is, not to love becauſe we arc loved again, but to love for Chriſt's ſake, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Members of Chriſt, becauſe we ſee his Picture and Image in them renewed, this is a ſpecial Grace of God: and of this love ſpeaks <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 16. <hi>All my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in his Saints which are in the Earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Sentence pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Reprobates is, <hi>Go ye Curſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels; for I was hungry, and you gave me no meat,</hi> &amp;c. In which Sentence are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a heap of woes, preſent, and to come: for the preſent, what can be more woful than to ſee ſo many admitted into the Kingdom of God, and yet themſelves ſhut out and excluded; yea, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſee them that they have hated, and diſdained, and refuſed to give any honour unto; as when the <hi>Rich man</hi> ſhall ſee <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> received by God into the Kingdom of Heaven, whom he vouchſafed not to ſet among his Servants; and that which is more, to ſee themſelves ſeparated, hated,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98571:107"/>and tugged by an innumerable ſort of ugly Devils, out of the preſence not only of God, but their Fathers, Mothers, Wives, Husbands, Children, Friends, Lovers, and Acquaintance, who ſhall deride and laugh at them, forgetting all bonds and obligations of Nature, and rejoycing at the execution of God's Juſtice in their Condemnation; ſo that no eye either of God or Man ſhall pity them, nor no tears, prayers, ſuits, cryes, yellings, or mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be heard, or prevail with him who is their Judge, nor one to mediate or ſpeak for them to reverſe or ſtay Judgment, but needs without mercy, without ſtay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farewel, they ſhall preſently be caſt even to the endleſs, eaſeleſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs torments of Hell. Never was there poor wretch that was condemned at the Tribunal of mortal Judgment, to be compared to this eſtate; for there the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Judges Sentence is, <hi>Lord have mercy upon thy Soul:</hi> but here, the Lord himſelf ſhall not only not ſhew any token of Mercy and loving Countenance, but alſo with a Voyce ſurpaſſing any Thunder-clap to be heard in all Heaven, Earth, and Hell, Curſe them Body and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98571:107"/>Soul to the Pit of Hell for evermore. And if this were all the preſent woe, yet were not the caſe ſo heavy, for beſides this, what guilt of Conſcience, what biting envy, what horrour of mind, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, what murmuring againſt the Lord, what curſing of themſelves, their day of birth, and Father and Mother, what remembrance of their former lives miſpent; and to conclude, what doth not the fear of Hell work upon them: ſurely my heart dreadeth, my mind faileth to think upon, to hear, to ſee, to conſider their wringing of hands, their knocking of breaſts, their cryes as it were filling of Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, and my Tongue and Pen cannot expreſs it, but muſt reſt with that ſaying, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 57.21.</p>
               <p>Now, Beloved, a few words by way of Comfort, and ſo I ſhall conclude. Firſt, What can be more comfortable to good men than to conſider and remember that the Lord hath appointed a day to Judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by the Man Chriſt Jeſus, which was dead and buried, and raiſed and aſcended, and ſitteth at
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98571:108"/>the right hand of God, which alſo is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Judge of quick and dead, againſt whom and for whoſe ſake the Wicked rage, and the Godly indure; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, He ſhall come, (<hi>viz.</hi> in the Clouds) which was interred in the Earth: the ſorrows of the Grave cannot hold him, no nor the Heavens when the latter day cometh, but he maketh his Clouds his Charriots, his Meſſengers flames of fire, burning up the World, and rideth upon the wings of the Wind, and cometh with the voices of Archangels Trumpets; <hi>Ariſe O you dead, and let all men come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> O, how happy ſhall it be that day with them, which have ſerved and kiſſed the Son, and that can ſay, <hi>For thy ſake we have been killed all the day long!</hi> How ſhall he recompence them, that have fed him? How ſhall he pay them, that by Almes-deeds and holy Works, have lent unto him? How ſhall he honour them, that have honoured him? How ſhall he revive and comfort them, that have died or mourned for him?<note place="margin">* See Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> upon the Creed.</note> And to conclude, Shall he not give them ten thouſand times more than all their evils amounted unto in this preſent World? Well!
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98571:108"/>
                  <hi>O Chriſt, we believe that thou ſhalt come to be our Judge: we therefore pray thee help thy Servants, whom thou haſt redeemed with thy precious blood; Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly, and make them to be numbred with thy Saints in glory everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now beloved, I ſhall ſpeak one word to the Place of Glory, and ſo I ſhall conclude this matter.</p>

            <pb n="218" facs="tcp:98571:110"/>
            <p n="2">2. Of ten Capital Sins which many men be (I fear) guilty of (if not ſome Churches alſo) which for brevity ſake are all reduced to two Heads, <hi>viz. Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> as alſo the remedies for the Cure of the Cankering Nature of theſe two great Sins; which is <hi>true Faith in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>ſincere Love</hi> to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An Eſſay for a right ſtating of the queſtion; <hi>Whether Chriſt died for all men?</hi> or, <hi>for the Elect only?</hi> Which when I have ſhewed you my meaning about it, by God's help, it may be a means towards an Union, which I hope is unfeignedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by ſome of both Parties: For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it would be very much to God's honour, and the Churches peace. And that I may attain to the end by me propounded as aforeſaid, I intend (God willing) if ever it be publiſhed to the view of the World, to proceed after this manner: As Firſt, To ſhew the End of Chriſt's Death, and the Application of his Death. Secondly, The Salvation wrought on Earth by Chriſt in his own Body with God for Men: And the Salvation in the Application thereof he worketh from Heaven by his Spirit in Men to God. Thirdly, God's Love of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98571:110"/>Compaſſion, and his Love of Delight. Fourthly, The Portion of Spirit ſent forth before Chriſt's Coming in the Fleſh, and ſince his Coming and Aſcenſion: All which the Scriptures make diſtinct: But they are uſually confounded by the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate; as I hope, by God's Grace, I ſhall be inabled to make it plainly appear. Now the reaſon why I did not Print it with this, was, becauſe it would make it too voluminous (or big) ſo that the poorer ſort of Chriſtians, for whoſe ſake it was chiefly intended, could not be able to but it. I could ſhew many more Reaſons, but ſhall forbear to declare them here.</p>
